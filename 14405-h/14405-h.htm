<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p>A few years ago the subject-matter of the present volume might
have been condensed into a few pages. Beyond what we would gather
from the Old Testament, we knew but little about the history and
geography of Canaan before the age of its conquest by the
Israelites. Thanks, however, to the discovery and decipherment of
the ancient monuments of Babylonia and Assyria, of Egypt and of
Palestine, all this is now changed. A flood of light has been
poured upon the earlier history of the country and its inhabitants,
and though we are still only at the beginning of our discoveries we
can already sketch the outlines of Canaanitish history, and even
fill them in here and there.</p>
<p>Throughout I have assumed that in the narrative of the
Pentateuch we have history and not fiction. Indeed the
archaeologist cannot do otherwise. Monumental research is making it
clearer every day that the scepticism of the so-called "higher
criticism" is not justified in fact. Those who <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>{4}</span> would examine
the proofs of this must turn to my book on <i>The Higher Criticism
and the Verdict of the Monuments</i>. There I have written purely
as an archaeologist, who belongs to no theological school, and
consequently readers of the work must see in it merely the
irreducible minimum of confidence in the historical trustworthiness
of the Old Testament, with which oriental archaeology can be
satisfied. But it is obvious that this irreducible minimum is a
good deal less than what a fair-minded historian will admit. The
archaeological facts support the traditional rather than the
so-called "critical" view of the age and authority of the
Pentateuch, and tend to show that we have in it not only a
historical monument whose statements can be trusted, but also what
is substantially a work of the great Hebrew legislator himself.</p>
<p>For those who "profess and call themselves Christians," however,
there is another side to the question besides the archaeological.
The modern "critical" views in regard to the Pentateuch are in
violent contradiction to the teaching and belief of the Jewish
Church in the time of our Lord, and this teaching and belief has
been accepted by Christ and His Apostles, and inherited by the
Christian Church. It is a teaching and belief which lies at the
root of many of the dogmas of the Church, and if we are to reject
or revise it, we must at the same time reject and revise historical
Christianity. It is difficult to see how we can call ourselves
Christians in the sense which the term <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>{5}</span> has borne for
the last eighteen hundred years, and at the same time repudiate or
modify, in accordance with our individual fancies, the articles of
faith which historical Christianity has maintained everywhere and
at all periods. For those who look beyond the covers of grammars
and lexicons, the great practical fact of historical Christianity
must outweigh all the speculations of individual scholars, however
ingenious and elaborate they may be. It is for the individual to
harmonize his conclusions with the immemorial doctrine of the
Church, not for the Church to reconcile its teaching with the
theories of the individual. Christ promised that the Spirit of God
should guide His Apostles and their followers into "all truth," and
those who believe the promise cannot also believe that the "Spirit
of Truth" has been at any time a Spirit of illusion.</p>
<p>Oriental archaeology, at all events, is on the side of those who
see in the Hebrew patriarchs real men of flesh and blood, and who
hold that in the narratives of the Pentateuch we have historical
records many of which go back to the age of the events they
describe. Each fresh discovery made by the archaeologist yields
fresh testimony to the truth of the Old Testament stories. Since
the manuscript of the present work was ready for the press, two
such discoveries have been made by Mr. Pinches, to whom oriental
archaeology and Biblical research are already under such deep
obligations, and it has been possible only to glance at them in the
text.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>{6}</span>
<p>He has found a broken cuneiform tablet which once gave an
account of the reign of Khammurabi, the contemporary of
Chedor-laomer and Arioch, of the wars that he carried on, and of
the steps by which he rose to the supreme power in Babylonia,
driving the Elamites out of it, overthrowing his rival Arioch, and
making Babylon for the first time the capital of a united kingdom.
Unfortunately the tablet is much broken, but what is left alludes
to his campaigns against Elam and Rabbatu&mdash;perhaps a city of
Palestine, of his reduction of Babylon, and of his successes
against Eri-Aku or Arioch of Larsa, Tudghulla or Tidal, the son of
Gazza ... and Kudur-Lagamar or Chedor-laomer himself. The Hebrew
text of Genesis has thus been verified even to the spelling of the
proper names. The other discovery of Mr. Pinches is still more
interesting. The name of Ab-ramu or Abram had already been found in
Babylonian contracts of the age of Khammurabi; Mr. Pinches has now
found in them the specifically Hebrew names of Ya'qub-ilu or
Jacob-el and Yasup-ilu or Joseph-el. It will be remembered that the
names of Jacob-el and Joseph-el had already been detected among the
places in Palestine conquered by the Egyptian monarch Thothmes
III., and it had been accordingly inferred that the full names of
the Hebrew patriarchs must have been Jacob-el and Joseph-el. Jacob
and Joseph are abbreviations analogous to Jephthah by the side of
Jiphthah-el (Josh. xix. 14), of Jeshurun by the side of Isra-el,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>{7}</span> or
of the Egyptian Yurahma by the side of the Biblical Jerahme-el. As
is mentioned in a later page, a discovery recently made by Prof.
Flinders Petrie has shown that the name of Jacob-el was actually
borne not only in Babylonia, but also in the West. Scarabs exist,
which he assigns to the period when Egypt was ruled by invaders
from Asia, and on which is written the name of a Pharaoh
Ya'aqub-hal or Jacob-el.</p>
<p>Besides the names of Jacob-el and Joseph-el, Mr. Pinches has met
with other distinctively Hebrew names, like Abdiel, in deeds drawn
up in the time of the dynasty to which Khammurabi belonged. There
were therefore Hebrews&mdash;or at least a Hebrew-speaking
population&mdash;living in Babylonia at the period to which the Old
Testament assigns the lifetime of Abraham. But this is not all. As
I pointed out five years ago, the name of Khammurabi himself, like
those of the rest of the dynasty of which he was a member, are not
Babylonian but South Arabian. The words with which they are
compounded, and the divine names which they contain, do not belong
to the Assyrian and Babylonian language, and there is a cuneiform
tablet in which they are given with their Assyrian translations.
The dynasty must have had close relations with South Arabia. This,
however, is not the most interesting part of the matter. The names
are not South Arabian only, they are Hebrew as well. That of
Khammu-rabi, for instance, is compounded with the name of the god
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>{8}</span>
'Am, which is written 'Ammi in the name of his descendant
Ammi-zaduqa, and 'Am or 'Ammi characterizes not only South Arabia,
but the Hebrew-speaking lands as well. We need only mention names
like Ammi-nadab or Ben-Ammi in illustration of the fact. Equally
Hebrew and South Arabian is <i>zaduqa</i> or <i>zadoq</i>; but it
was a word unknown to the Assyrian language of Babylonia.</p>
<p>When Abraham therefore was born in Ur of the Chaldees, a dynasty
was ruling there which was not of Babylonian origin, but belonged
to a race which was at once Hebrew and South Arabian. The contract
tablets prove that a population with similar characteristics was
living under them in the country. Could there be a more remarkable
confirmation of the statements which we find in the tenth chapter
of Genesis? There we read that "unto Eber were born two sons: the
name of the one was Peleg," the ancestor of the Hebrews, while the
name of the other was Joktan, the ancestor of the tribes of South
Arabia. The parallelism between the Biblical account and the latest
discovery of archaeological science is thus complete, and makes it
impossible to believe that the Biblical narrative would have been
compiled in Palestine at the late date to which our modern
"critics" would assign it. All recollection of the facts embodied
in it would then have long passed away.</p>
<p>Even while I write Prof. Hommel is announcing fresh discoveries
which bear on the early history <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page9" id="page9"></a>{9}</span> of the Book of Genesis. Cuneiform
tablets have turned up from which we gather that centuries before
the age of Abraham, a king of Ur, Ine-Sin by name, had not only
overrun Elam, but had also conquered Simurru, the Zemar of Gen. x.
18, in the land of Phoenicia. A daughter of the same king or of one
of his immediate successors, was high-priestess both of Elam and of
Markhas or Mer'ash in Northern Syria, while Kimas or Northern
Arabia was overrun by the Babylonian arms. Proofs consequently are
multiplying of the intimate relations that existed between
Babylonia and Western Asia long before the era of the Patriarchs,
and we need no longer feel any surprise that Abraham should have
experienced so little difficulty in migrating into Canaan, or that
he should have found there the same culture as that which he had
left behind in Ur. The language and script of Babylonia must have
been almost as well known to the educated Canaanite as to himself,
and the records of the Patriarchal Age would have been preserved in
the libraries of Canaan down to the time of its conquest by the
Israelites.</p>
<p>Perhaps a word or two is needed in explanation of the
repetitions which will be found here and there in the following
pages. They have been necessitated by the form into which I have
been obliged to cast the book. A consecutive history of Patriarchal
Palestine cannot be written at present, if indeed it ever can be,
and the subject therefore has to be treated under a series of
separate heads. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id=
"page10"></a>{10}</span> This has sometimes made repetitions
unavoidable without a sacrifice of clearness.</p>
<p>In conclusion it will be noted, that the name of the people who
were associated with the Philistines in their wars against Egypt
and occupation of Palestine has been changed from Zakkur to Zakkal.
This has been in consequence of a keen-sighted observation of Prof.
Hommel. He has pointed out that in a Babylonian text of the Kassite
period, the people in question are mentioned under the name of
Zaqqalu, which settles the reading of the hieroglyphic word. (See
the <i>Proceedings</i> of the Society of Biblical Archaeology for
May 1895.)</p>

<h3>THE LAND</h3>
<p>Patriarchal Palestine! There are some who would tell us that the
very name is a misnomer. Have we not been assured by the German
critics and their English disciples that there were no patriarchs
and no Patriarchal Age? And yet, the critics notwithstanding, the
Patriarchal Age has actually existed. While criticism, so-called,
has been busy in demolishing the records of the Pentateuch,
archaeology, by the spade of the excavator and the patient skill of
the decipherer, has been equally busy in restoring their credit.
And the monuments of the past are a more solid argument than the
guesses and prepossessions of the modern theorist. The clay tablet
and inscribed stone are better witnesses to the truth than literary
tact or critical scepticism. That Moses and his contemporaries
could neither read nor write may <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page16" id="page16"></a>{16}</span> have been proved to
demonstration by the critic; yet nevertheless we now know, thanks
to archaeological discovery, that it would have been a miracle if
the critic were right. The Pentateuch is, after all, what it
professes to be, and the records it contains are history and not
romance.</p>
<p>The question of its authenticity involves issues more serious
and important than those which have to do merely with history or
archaeology. We are sometimes told indeed, in all honesty of
purpose, that it is a question of purely literary interest, without
influence on our theological faith. But the whole fabric of the
Jewish Church in the time of our Lord was based upon the belief
that the Law of Moses came from God, and that this God "is not a
man that He should lie." And the belief of the Jewish Church was
handed on to the Christian Church along with all its consequences.
To revise that belief is to revise the dogmas of the Christian
Church as they have been held for the last eighteen centuries; to
reject it utterly is to reject the primary document of the faith
into which we have been baptized.</p>
<p>It is not, however, with theological matters that we are now
concerned. Patriarchal Palestine is for us the Palestine of the
Patriarchal Age, as it has been disclosed by archaeological
research, not the Palestine in which the revelation of God's will
to man was to be made. It is sufficient for us that the Patriarchal
Age has been shown by modern discovery to be a fact, and that in
the narratives of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id=
"page17"></a>{17}</span> the Book of Genesis we have authentic
records of the past. There was indeed a Patriarchal Palestine, and
the glimpses of it that we get in the Old Testament have been
illustrated and supplemented by the ancient monuments of the
Oriental world.</p>
<p>Whether the name of Palestine can be applied to the country with
strict accuracy at this early period is a different question.
Palestine is Philistia, the land of the Philistines, and the
introduction of the name was subsequent to the settlement of the
Philistines in Canaan and the era of their victories over Israel.
As we shall see later on, it is probable that they did not reach
the Canaanitish coast until the Patriarchal Age was almost, if not
entirely, past Their name does not occur in the cuneiform
correspondence which was carried on between Canaan and Egypt in the
century before the Exodus, and they are first heard of as forming
part of that great confederacy of northern tribes which attacked
Egypt and Canaan in the days of Moses. But, though the term Canaan
would doubtless be more correct than Palestine, the latter has
become so purely geographical in meaning that we can employ it
without reference to history or date. Its signification is too
familiar to cause mistakes, and it can therefore be used
proleptically, just as the name of the Philistines themselves is
used proleptically in the twenty-first chapter of Genesis.
Abimelech was king of a people who inhabited the same part of the
country as the Philistines in later times, and were thus their
earlier representatives.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>{18}</span>
<p>The term "Palestine" then is used geographically without any
reference to its historical origin. It denotes the country which is
known as Canaan in the Old Testament, which was promised to Abraham
and conquered by his descendants. It is the land in which David
ruled and in which Christ was born, where the prophets prepared the
way for the Gospel and the Christian Church was founded.</p>
<p>Shut in between the Desert of Arabia and the Mediterranean Sea
on the east and west, it is a narrow strip of territory, for the
most part mountainous, rugged, and barren. Northward the Lebanon
and Anti-Lebanon come to meet it from Syria, the Anti-Lebanon
culminating in the lofty peaks and precipitous ravines of Mount
Hermon (9383 feet above the level of the sea), while Lebanon runs
southward till it juts out into the sea in its sacred headland of
Carmel. The fertile plain of Esdraelon or Megiddo separates the
mountains of the north from those of the south. These last form a
broken plateau between the Jordan and the Dead Sea on the one side
and the Plain of Sharon and the sea-coast of the Philistines on the
other, until they finally slope away into the arid desert of the
south. Here, on the borders of the wilderness, was Beersheba the
southern limit of the land in the days of the monarchy, Dan, its
northern limit, lying far away to the north at the foot of Hermon,
and not far from the sources of the Jordan.</p>
<p>Granite and gneiss, overlaid with hard dark sandstone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>{19}</span>
and masses of secondary limestone, form as it were the skeleton of
the country. Here and there, at Carmel and Gerizim, patches of the
tertiary nummulite of Egypt make their appearance, and in the
plains of Megiddo and the coast, as well as in the "Ghor" or valley
of the Jordan, there is rich alluvial soil. But elsewhere all is
barren or nearly so, cultivation being possible only by terracing
the cliffs, and bringing the soil up to them from the plains below
with slow and painful labour. It has often been said that Palestine
was more widely cultivated in ancient times than it is to-day. But
if so, this was only because a larger area of the cultivable ground
was tilled. The plains of the coast, which are now given over to
malaria and Beduin thieves, were doubtless thickly populated and
well sown. But of ground actually fit for cultivation there could
not have been a larger amount than there is at present.</p>
<p>It was not in any way a well-wooded land. On the slopes of the
Lebanon and of Carmel, it is true, there were forests of
cedar-trees, a few of which still survive, and the Assyrian kings
more than once speak of cutting them down or using them in their
buildings at Nineveh. But south of the Lebanon forest trees were
scarce; the terebinth was so unfamiliar a sight in the landscape as
to become an object of worship or a road-side mark. Even the palm
grew only on the sea-coast or in the valley of the Jordan, and the
tamarisk and sycamore were hardly more than shrubs.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>{20}</span>
<p>Nevertheless when the Israelites first entered Canaan, it was in
truth a land "flowing with milk and honey." Goats abounded on the
hills, and the bee of Palestine, though fierce, is still famous for
its honey-producing powers. The Perizzites or "fellahin"
industriously tilled the fields, and high-walled cities stood on
the mountain as well as on the plain.</p>
<p>The highlands, however, were deficient in water. A few streams
fall into the sea south of Carmel, but except in the spring, when
they have been swollen by the rains, there is but little water in
them. The Kishon, which irrigates the plain of Megiddo, is a more
important river, but it too is little more than a mountain stream.
In fact, the Jordan is the only river in the true sense of the word
which Palestine possesses. Rising to the north of the waters of
Merom, now called Lake H&ucirc;leh, it flows first into the Lake of
Tiberias, and then through a long deep valley into the Dead Sea.
Here at a depth of 1293 feet below the level of the sea it is
swallowed up and lost; the sea has no outlet, and parts with its
stagnant waters through evaporation alone. The evaporation has made
it intensely salt, and its shores are consequently for the most
part the picture of death.</p>
<p>In the valley of the Jordan, on the other hand, vegetation is as
luxuriant and tropical as in the forests of Brazil. Through a dense
undergrowth of canes and shrubs the river forces its way, rushing
forward towards its final gulf of extinction <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>{21}</span> with a fall
of 670 feet since it left the Lake of Tiberias. But the distance
thus travelled by it is long in comparison with its earlier fall of
625 feet between Lake H&ucirc;leh and the Sea of Galilee. Here it
has cut its way through a deep gorge, the cliffs of which rise up
almost sheer on either side.</p>
<p>The Jordan has taken its name from its rapid fall. The word
comes from a root which signifies "to descend," and the name itself
means "the down-flowing." We can trace it back to the Egyptian
monuments of the nineteenth and twentieth dynasties. Ramses II.,
the Pharaoh of the Oppression, has inscribed it on the walls of
Karnak, and Ramses III., who must have reigned while the Israelites
were still in the wilderness, enumerates the "Yordan" at
Med&icirc;net Habu among his conquests in Palestine. In both cases
it is associated with "the Lake of Rethpana," which must
accordingly be the Egyptian name of the Dead Sea. Rethpana might
correspond with a Hebrew Reshph&ocirc;n, a derivative from Resheph,
the god of fire. Canaanite mythology makes the sparks his
"children" (Job v. 7) and it may be, therefore, that in this old
name of the Dead Sea we have a reference to the overthrow of the
cities of the plain.</p>
<p>Eastward of the Dead Sea and the Jordan the country is again
mountainous and bare. Here were the territories of Reuben and Gad,
and the half-tribe of Manasseh; here also were the kingdoms of Moab
and Ammon, of Bashan and the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page22"
id="page22"></a>{22}</span> Amorites. Here too was the land of
Gilead, south of the Lake of Tiberias and north of the Dead
Sea.</p>
<p>We can read the name of Muab or Moab on the base of the second
of the six colossal statues which Ramses II. erected in front of
the northern pylon of the temple of Luxor. It is there included
among his conquests. The statue is the only Egyptian monument on
which the name has hitherto been found. But this single mention is
sufficient to guarantee its antiquity, and to prove that in the
days before the Exodus it was already well known in Egypt.</p>
<p>To the north of Moab came the kingdom of Ammon, or the children
of Ammi. The name of Ammon was a derivative from that of the god
Ammi or Ammo, who seems to have been regarded as the ancestor of
the nation, and "the father of the children of Ammon" was
accordingly called Ben-Ammi, "the son of Ammi" (Gen. xix. 38). Far
away in the north, close to the junction of the rivers Euphrates
and Sajur, and but a few miles to the south of the Hittite
stronghold of Carchemish, the worship of the same god seems to have
been known to the Aramaean tribes. It was here that Pethor stood,
according to the Assyrian inscriptions, and it was from Pethor that
the seer Balaam came to Moab to curse the children of Israel.
Pethor, we are told, was "by the river (Euphrates) of the land of
the children of Ammo," where the word represents a proper name
(Num. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id=
"page23"></a>{23}</span> xxii. 5). To translate it "his people," as
is done by the Authorized Version, makes no sense. On the Assyrian
monuments Ammon is sometimes spoken of as Beth-Ammon, "the house of
Ammon," as if Ammon had been a living man.</p>
<p>Like Moab, Ammon was a region of limestone mountains and barren
cliffs. But there were fertile fields on the banks of the Jabbok,
the sources of which rose not far from the capital Rabbath.</p>
<p>North of Gilead and the Yarmuk was the volcanic plateau of
Bashan, Ziri-Basana, or "the Plain of Bashan," as it is termed in
the cuneiform tablets of Tel el-Amarna. Its western slope towards
the Lakes of Merom and Tiberias was known as Golan (now
Jol&acirc;n); its eastern plateau of metallic lava was Argob, "the
stony" (now El Lejja). Bashan was included in the Haur&acirc;n, the
name of which we first meet with on the monuments of the Assyrian
king Assur-bani-pal. To the north it was bounded by Ituraea, so
named from Jetur, the son of Ishmael (Gen. xxv. 15), the road
through Ituraea (the modern Jedur) leading to Damascus and its
well-watered plain.</p>
<p>The gardens of Damascus lie 2260 feet above the sea. In the
summer the air is cooled by the mountain breezes; in the winter the
snow sometimes lies upon the surface of the land. Westward the view
is closed by the white peaks of Anti-Lebanon and Hermon; eastward
the eye wanders over a green plain covered with the mounds of old
towns and villages, and intersected by the clear <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>{24}</span> and rapid
streams of the Abana and Pharphar. But the Abana has now become the
Barada, or "cold one," while the Pharphar is the Nahr el-Awaj.</p>
<p>The Damascus of to-day stands on the site of the city from which
St. Paul escaped, and "the street which is called Straight" can
still be traced by its line of Roman columns. But it is doubtful
whether the Damascus of the New Testament and of to-day is the same
as the Damascus of the Old Testament. Where the walls of the city
have been exposed to view, we see that their Greek foundations rest
on the virgin soil; no remains of an earlier period lie beneath
them. It may be, therefore, that the Damascus of Ben-Hadad and
Hazael is marked rather by one of the mounds in the plain than by
the modern town. In one of these the stone statue of a man, in the
Assyrian style, was discovered a few years ago.</p>
<p>An ancient road leads from the peach-orchards of Damascus, along
the banks of the Abana and over Anti-Lebanon, to the ruins of the
temple of the Sun-god at Baalbek. The temple as we see it is of the
age of the Antonines, but it occupies the place of one which stood
in Heliopolis, the city of the Sun-god, from immemorial antiquity.
Relics of an older epoch still exist in the blocks of stone of
colossal size which serve as the foundation of the western wall.
Their bevelling reminds us of Phoenician work.</p>
<p>Baalbek was the sacred city of the Bek'a, or "cleft" formed
between Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page25" id="page25"></a>{25}</span> by the gorge through which the
river Lit&acirc;ny rushes down to the sea. Once and once only is it
referred to in the Old Testament. Amos (i. 5) declares that the
Lord "will break the bar of Damascus and cut off the inhabitant
from Bikath-On"&mdash;the Bek'a of On. The name of On reminds us
that the Heliopolis of Egypt, the city of the Egyptian Sun-god, was
also called On, and the question arises whether the name and
worship of the On of Syria were not derived from the On of Egypt.
For nearly two centuries Syria was an Egyptian province, and the
priests of On in Egypt may well have established themselves in the
"cleft" valley of Coele-Syria.</p>
<p>From Baalbek, the city of "Baal of the Bek'a," the traveller
makes his way across Lebanon, and under the snows of Jebel
Sann&icirc;n&mdash;nearly 9000 feet in height&mdash;to the old
Phoenician city of Beyrout. Beyrout is already mentioned in the
cuneiform tablets of Tel el-Amarna under the name of Beruta or
Beruna, "the cisterns." It was already a seaport of Phoenicia, and
a halting-place on the high road that ran along the coast.</p>
<p>The coastland was known to the Greeks and Romans as Phoenicia,
"the land of the palm." But its own inhabitants called it Canaan,
"the lowlands." It included not only the fringe of cultivated land
by the sea-shore, but the western slopes of the Lebanon as well.
Phoenician colonies and outposts had been planted inland, far away
from the coast, as at Laish, the future Dan, where <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>{26}</span> "the people
dwelt careless," though "they were far away from the Sidonians," or
at Zemar (the modern Sumra) and Arka (still called by the same
name). The territory of the Phoenicians stretched southward as far
as Dor (now Tanturah), where it met the advance guard of the
Philistines.</p>
<p>Such was Palestine, the promised home of Israel. It was a land
of rugged and picturesque mountains, interspersed with a few tracts
of fertile country, shut in between the sea and the ravine of the
Jordan, and falling away into the waterless desert of the south. It
was, too, a land of small extent, hardly more than one hundred and
sixty miles in length and sixty miles in width. And even this
amount of territory was possessed by the Israelites only during the
reigns of David and Solomon. The sea-coast with its harbours was in
the hands of the Phoenicians and the Philistines, and though the
Philistines at one time owned an unwilling allegiance to the Jewish
king, the Phoenicians preserved their independence, and even
Solomon had to find harbours for his merchantmen, not on the coast
of his own native kingdom, but in the distant Edomite ports of
Eloth and Ezion-geber, in the Gulf of Aqabah. With the loss of Edom
Judah ceased to have a foreign trade.</p>
<p>The Negeb, or desert of the south, was then, what it still is,
the haunt of robbers and marauders. The Beduin of to-day are the
Amalekites of Old Testament history; and then, as now, they
infested the southern frontier of Judah, wasting and robbing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>{27}</span>
the fields of the husbandman, and allying themselves with every
invader who came from the south, Saul, indeed, punished them, as
Romans and Turks have punished them since; but the lesson is
remembered only for a short while: when the strong hand is removed,
the "sons of the desert" return again like the locusts to their
prey.</p>
<p>It is true that the Beduin now range over the loamy plains and
encamp among the marshes of Lake H&ucirc;leh, where in happier
times their presence was unknown. But this is the result of a weak
and corrupt government, added to the depopulation of the lowlands.
There are traces even in the Old Testament that in periods of
anarchy and confusion the Amalekites penetrated far into the
country in a similar fashion. In the Song of Deborah and Barak
Ephraim is said to have contended against them, and accordingly
"Pirathon in the land of Ephraim" is described as being "in the
mount of the Amalekites" (Judges xii. 15). In the cuneiform tablets
of Tel el-Amarna, too, there is frequent mention of the
"Plunderers" by whom the Beduin, the Shasu of the Egyptian texts,
must be meant, and who seem to have been generally ready at hand to
assist a rebellious vassal or take part in a civil feud.</p>
<p>Lebanon, the "white" mountain, took its name from its cliffs of
glistening limestone. In the early days of Canaan it was believed
to be the habitation of the gods, and Phoenician inscriptions exist
dedicated to Baal-Lebanon, "the Baal of Lebanon." <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>{28}</span> He was the
special form of the Sun-god whose seat was in the mountain-ranges
that shut in Phoenicia on the east, and whose spirit was supposed
to dwell in some mysterious way in the mountains themselves. But
there were certain peaks which lifted themselves up prominently to
heaven, and in which consequently the sanctity of the whole range
was as it were concentrated. It was upon their summits that the
worshipper felt himself peculiarly near the God of heaven, and
where therefore the altar was built and the sacrifice performed.
One of these peaks was Hermon, "the consecrated," whose name the
Greeks changed into Harmonia, the wife of Agenor the Phoenician.
From its top we can see Palestine spread as it were before us, and
stretching southwards to the mountains of Judah. The walls of the
temple, which in Greek times took the place of the primitive altar,
can still be traced there, and on its slopes, or perched above its
ravines, are the ruins of other temples of Baal&mdash;at D&ecirc;r
el-'Ashair, at Rakleh, at Ain Hersha, at Rash&ecirc;yat
el-Fukh&acirc;r&mdash;all pointing towards the central sanctuary on
the summit of the mountain.</p>
<p>The name of Hermon, "the consecrated," was but an epithet, and
the mountain had other and more special names of its own. The
Sidonians, we are told (Deut. iii. 9), called it Sirion, and
another of its titles was Sion (Deut. iv. 48), unless indeed this
is a corrupt reading for Sirion. Its Amorite name was Shenir (Deut.
iii. 9), which appears <span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id=
"page29"></a>{29}</span> as Saniru in an Assyrian inscription, and
goes back to the earliest dawn of history. When the Babylonians
first began to make expeditions against the West, long before the
birth of Abraham, the name of Sanir was already known. It was then
used to denote the whole of Syria, so that its restriction to Mount
Hermon alone must have been of later date.</p>
<p>Another holy peak was Carmel, "the fruitful field," or perhaps
originally "the domain of the god." It was in Mount Carmel that the
mountain ranges of the north ended finally, and the altar on its
summit could be seen from afar by the Phoenician sailors. Here the
priests of Baal called in vain upon their god that he might send
them rain, and here was "the altar of the Lord" which Elijah
repaired.</p>
<p>The mountains of the south present no striking peak or headland
like Hermon and Carmel. Even Tabor belongs to the north. Ebal and
Gerizim alone, above Shechem, stand out among their fellows, and
were venerated as the abodes of deity from the earliest times. The
temple-hill at Jerusalem owed its sanctity rather to the city
within the boundaries of which it stood than to its own character.
In fact, the neighbouring height of Zion towered above it. The
mountains of the south were rather highlands than lofty chains and
isolated peaks.</p>
<p>But on this very account they played an important part in the
history of the world. They were not too high to be habitable; they
were high <span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id=
"page30"></a>{30}</span> enough to protect their inhabitants
against invasion and war. "Mount Ephraim," the block of mountainous
land of which Shechem and Samaria formed the centre, and at the
southern extremity of which the sacred city of Shiloh stood, was
the natural nucleus of a kingdom, like the southern block of which
Hebron and Jerusalem were similarly the capitals. Here there were
valleys and uplands in which sufficient food could be grown for the
needs of the population, while the cities with their thick and
lofty walls were strongholds difficult to approach and still more
difficult to capture. The climate was bracing, though the winters
were cold, and it reared a race of hardy warriors and industrious
agriculturists. The want of water was the only difficulty; in most
cases the people were dependent on rain-water, which they preserved
in cisterns cut out of the rock.</p>
<p>This block of southern mountains was the first and latest
stronghold of Israel. It constituted, in fact, the kingdoms of
Samaria and Judah. Out of it, at Shechem, came the first attempt to
found a monarchy in Israel, and thus unite the Israelitish tribes;
out of it also came the second and more successful attempt under
Saul the Benjamite and David the Jew. The Israelites never
succeeded in establishing themselves on the sea-coast, and their
possession of the plain of Megiddo and the southern slopes of the
Lebanon was a source of weakness and not of strength. It led
eventually to the overthrow of the kingdom of Samaria. The northern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>{31}</span>
tribes in Galilee were absorbed by the older population, and their
country became "Galilee of the Gentiles," rather than an integral
part of Israel. The plain of Megiddo was long held by the
Canaanites, and up to the last was exposed to invasion from the
sea-coast. It was, in fact, the battle-field of Palestine. The army
of the invader or the conqueror marched along the edge of the sea,
not through the rugged paths and dangerous defiles of the
mountainous interior, and the plain of Megiddo was the pass which
led them into its midst. The possession of the plain cut off the
mountaineers of the north from their brethren in the south, and
opened the way into the heart of the mountains themselves.</p>
<p>But to possess the plain was also to possess chariots and
horsemen, and a large and disciplined force. The guerilla warfare
of the mountaineer was here of no avail. Success lay on the side of
the more numerous legions and the wealthier state, on the side of
the assailant and not of the assailed.</p>
<p>Herein lay the advantage of the kingdom of Judah. It was a
compact state, with no level plain to defend, no outlying
territories to protect. Its capital stood high upon the mountains,
strongly fortified by nature and difficult of access. While Samaria
fell hopelessly and easily before the armies of Assyria, Jerusalem
witnessed the fall of Nineveh itself.</p>
<p>What was true of the later days of Israelitish <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>{32}</span> history was
equally true of the age of the patriarchs. The strength of
Palestine lay in its southern highlands; whoever gained possession
of these was master of the whole country, and the road lay open
before him to Sinai and Egypt. But to gain possession of them was
the difficulty, and campaign after campaign was needed before they
could be reduced to quiet submission. In the time of the eighteenth
Egyptian dynasty Jerusalem was already the key to Southern
Palestine.</p>
<p>Geographically, Palestine was thus a country of twofold
character, and its population was necessarily twofold as well. It
was a land of mountain and plain, of broken highlands and rocky
sea-coast. Its people were partly mountaineers, active, patriotic,
and poor, with a tendency to asceticism; partly a nation of sailors
and merchants, industrious, wealthy, and luxurious, with no sense
of country or unity, and accounting riches the supreme end of life.
On the one hand, it gave the world its first lessons in maritime
exploration and trade; on the other it has been the religious
teacher of mankind.</p>
<p>In both respects its geographical position has aided the work of
its people. Situated midway between the two great empires of the
ancient Oriental world, it was at once the high road and the
meeting-place of the civilizations of Egypt and Babylonia. Long
before Abraham migrated to Canaan it had been deeply
interpenetrated by Babylonian culture and religious ideas, and long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>{33}</span>
before the Exodus it had become an Egyptian province. It barred the
way to Egypt for the invader from Asia; it protected Asia from
Egyptian assault. The trade of the world passed through it and met
in it; the merchants of Egypt and Ethiopia could traffic in
Palestine with the traders of Babylonia and the far East. It was
destined by nature to be a land of commerce and trade.</p>
<p>And yet while thus forming a highway from the civilization of
the Euphrates to that of the Nile, Palestine was too narrow a strip
of country to become itself a formidable kingdom. The empire of
David scarcely lasted for more than a single generation, and was
due to the weakness at the same time of both Egypt and Assyria.
With the Arabian desert on the one side and the Mediterranean on
the other, it was impossible for Canaan to develop into a great
state. Its rocks and mountains might produce a race of hardy
warriors and energetic thinkers, but they could not create a rich
and populous community. The Phoenicians on the coast were driven
towards the sea, and had to seek in maritime enterprise the food
and wealth which their own land refused to grant. Palestine was
essentially formed to be the appropriator and carrier of the ideas
and culture of others, not to be itself their origin and
creator.</p>
<p>But when the ideas had once been brought to it they were
modified and combined, improved and generalized in a way that made
them capable of universal acceptance. Phoenician art is in no way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>{34}</span>
original; its elements have been drawn partly from Babylonia,
partly from Egypt; but their combination was the work of the
Phoenicians, and it was just this combination which became the
heritage of civilized man. The religion of Israel came from the
wilderness, from the heights of Sinai, and the palm-grove of
Kadesh, but it was in Palestine that it took shape and developed,
until in the fullness of time the Messiah was born. Out of Canaan
have come the Prophets and the Gospel, but the Law which lay behind
them was brought from elsewhere.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>{35}</span>
<h2><a name="chap2" id="chap2">CHAPTER II</a></h2>
<h3>THE PEOPLE</h3>
<p>In the days of Abraham, Chedor-laomer, king of Elam and lord
over the kings of Babylonia, marched westward with his Babylonian
allies, in order to punish his rebellious subjects in Canaan. The
invading army entered Palestine from the eastern side of the
Jordan. Instead of marching along the sea-coast, it took the line
of the valley of the Jordan. It first attacked the plateau of
Bashan, and then smote "the Rephaim in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the
Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in the plain of Kiriathaim." Then it
passed into Mount Seir, and subjugated the Horites as far as
El-Paran "by the wilderness." Thence it turned northward again
through the oasis of En-mishpat or Kadesh-barnea, and after smiting
the Amalekite Beduin, as well as the Amorites in Hazezon-tamar,
made its way into the vale of Siddim. There the battle took place
which ended in the defeat of the king of Sodom and his allies, who
were carried away captive to the north. But at Hobah, "on the left
hand of Damascus," the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id=
"page36"></a>{36}</span> invaders were overtaken by "Abram the
Hebrew," who dwelt with his Amorite confederates in the plain of
Mamre, and the spoil they had seized was recovered from them.</p>
<p>The narrative gives us a picture of the geography and ethnology
of Palestine as it was at the beginning of the Patriarchal Age.
Before that age was over it had altered very materially; the old
cities for the most part still remained, but new races had taken
the place of the older ones, new kingdoms had arisen, and the
earlier landmarks had been displaced. The Amalekite alone continued
what he had always been, the untamable nomad of the southern
desert.</p>
<p>Rephaim or "Giants" was a general epithet applied to the
prehistoric population of the country. Og, king of Bashan in the
time of the Exodus, was "of the remnant of the Rephaim" (Deut. iii.
11); but so also were the Anakim in Hebron, the Emim in Moab, and
the Zamzummim in Ammon (Deut. ii. 11, 20). Doubtless they
represented a tall race in comparison with the Hebrews and Arabs of
the desert; and the Israelitish spies described themselves as
grasshoppers by the side of them (Numb. xiii. 33). It is possible,
however, that the name was really an ethnic one, which had only an
accidental similarity in sound to the Hebrew word for "giants." At
all events, in the list of conquered Canaanitish towns which the
Pharaoh Thothmes III. of Egypt caused to be engraved on the walls
of Karnak, the name of Astartu or Ashteroth <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>{37}</span> Karnaim is
followed by that of Anaurep&acirc;, in which Mr. Tomkins proposes
to see On-Repha, "On of the Giant(s)." In the close neighbourhood
in classical days stood Raph&ocirc;n or Raphana, Arpha of the
Dekapolis, now called Er-R&acirc;feh, and in Raph&ocirc;n it is
difficult not to discern a reminiscence of the Rephaim of
Genesis.</p>
<p>Did these Rephaim belong to the same race as the Emim and the
Anakim, or were the latter called Rephaim or "Giants" merely
because they represented the tall prehistoric population of Canaan?
The question can be more easily asked than answered. We know from
the Book of Genesis that Amorites as well as Hittites lived at
Hebron, or in its immediate vicinity. Abram dwelt in the plain of
Mamre along with three Amorite chieftains, and Hoham, king of
Hebron, who fought against Joshua, is accounted among the Amorites
(Josh. x. 1). The Anakim may therefore have been an Amorite tribe.
They held themselves to be the descendants of Anak, an ancient
Canaanite god, whose female counterpart was the Phoenician goddess
Onka. But, on the other hand, the Amorites at Hebron may have been
intruders; we know that Hebron was peculiarly a Hittite city, and
it is at Mamre rather than at Hebron that the Amorite confederates
of Abram had their home. It is equally possible that the Anakim
themselves may have been the stranger element; we hear nothing
about them in the days of the patriarchs, and it is only when the
Israelites prepare to enter <span class="pagenum"><a name="page38"
id="page38"></a>{38}</span> Canaan that they first make their
appearance upon the stage.</p>
<p>Og, king of Bashan, however, was an Amorite; of this we are
assured in the Book of Deuteronomy (iii. 8), and it is further said
of him that he only "remained of the remnant of the Rephaim." The
expression is a noticeable one, as it implies that the older
population had been for the most part driven out. And such, in
fact, was the case. At Rabbath, the capital of Ammon, the basalt
sarcophagus of the last king of Bashan was preserved; but the king
and his people had alike perished. Ammonites and Israelites had
taken their place.</p>
<p>The children of Ammon had taken possession of the land once
owned by the Zamzummim (Deut. ii. 20). The latter are called Zuzim
in the narrative of Genesis, and they are said to have dwelt in
Ham. But Zuzim and Ham are merely faulty transcriptions from a
cuneiform text of the Hebrew Zamzummim and Ammon, and the same
people are meant both in Genesis and in Deuteronomy. In Deuteronomy
also the Emim are mentioned, and their geographical position
defined. They were the predecessors of the Moabites, and like the
Zamzummim, "a people great and many and tall," whom the Moabites
expelled doubtless at the same time as that at which the Ammonites
conquered the Zamzummim. The "plain of Kiriathaim," or "the two
cities," must have lain south of the Arnon, where Ar and Kir
Haraseth were built.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>{39}</span>
<p>South of the Emim, in the rose-red mountains of Seir, afterwards
occupied by the Edomites, came the Horites, whose name is generally
supposed to be derived from a Hebrew word signifying "a cave." They
have therefore been regarded as Troglodytes, or cave-dwellers, a
savage race of men who possessed neither houses nor settled home.
But it is quite possible to connect the name with another word
which means "white," and to see in them the representatives of a
white race. The name of Hor is associated with Beth-lehem, and
Caleb, of the Edomite tribe of Kenaz, is called "the son of Hur" (1
Chron. ii. 50, iv. 4). There is no reason for believing that
cave-dwellers ever existed in that part of Palestine.</p>
<p>The discovery of the site of Kadesh-barnea is due in the first
instance to Dr. Rowlands, secondly to the archaeological skill of
Dr. Clay Trumbull. It is still known as 'Ain Qad&icirc;s, "the
spring of Qadis," and lies hidden within the block of mountains
which rise in the southern desert about midway between Mount Seir
and the Mediterranean Sea. The water still gushes out of the rock,
fresh and clear, and nourishes the oasis that surrounds it. It has
been marked out by nature to be a meeting-place and "sanctuary" of
the desert tribes. Its central position, its security from sudden
attack, and its abundant supply of water all combined to make it
the En-Mishpat or "Spring of Judgment," where cases were tried and
laws enacted. It was here that the Israelites lingered year after
year <span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id=
"page40"></a>{40}</span> during their wanderings in the wilderness,
and it was from hence that the spies were sent out to explore the
Promised Land. In those days the mountains which encircled it were
known as "the mountains of the Amorites" (Deut. i. 19, 20). In the
age of the Babylonian invasion, however, the Amorites had not
advanced so far to the south. They were as yet only at
Hazezon-tamar, the "palm-grove" on the western shore of the Dead
Sea, which a later generation called En-gedi (2 Chron. xx. 2).
En-Mishpat was still in the hands of the Amalekites, the lords of
"all the country" round about.</p>
<p>The Amalekites had not as yet intermingled with the Ishmaelites,
and their Beduin blood was still pure. They were the Shasu or
"Plunderers" of the Egyptian inscriptions, sometimes also termed
the Sitti, the Sute of the cuneiform texts. Like their modern
descendants, they lived by the plunder of their more peaceful
neighbours. As was prophesied of Ishmael, so could it have been
prophesied of the Amalekites, that their "hand should be against
every man, and every man's hand against" them. They were the wild
offspring of the wilderness, and accounted the first-born of
mankind (Numb. xxiv. 20).</p>
<p>From En-Mishpat the Babylonian forces marched northward along
the western edge of the Dead Sea. Leaving Jerusalem on their left,
they descended into the vale of Siddim, where they found themselves
in the valley of the Jordan, and consequently in <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>{41}</span> the land of
the Canaanites. As we are told in the Book of Numbers (xiii. 29),
while "the Amalekites dwell in the land of the south, and the
Hittites and the Jebusites and Amorites dwell in the mountains, the
Canaanites dwell by the sea and by the coast of Jordan."</p>
<p>The word Canaan, as we have seen, meant "the lowlands," and
appears sometimes in a longer, sometimes in a shorter form. The
shorter form is written Khna by the Greeks: in the Tel el-Amarna
tablets it is Kinakhkhi, while Canaan, the longer form, is
Kinakhna. It is this longer form which alone appears in the
hieroglyphic texts. Here we read how Seti I. destroyed the Shasu or
Amalekites from the eastern frontier of Egypt to "the land of
Kana'an," and captured their fortress of the same name which Major
Conder has identified with Khurbet Kan'an near Hebron. It was also
the longer form which was preserved among the Israelites as well as
among the Phoenicians, the original inhabitants of the sea-coast.
Coins of Laodicea, on the Orontes, bear the inscription, "Laodicea
a metropolis in Canaan," and St. Augustine states that in his time
the Carthaginian peasantry of Northern Africa, if questioned as to
their descent, still answered that they were "Canaanites." (<i>Exp.
Epist. ad Rom.</i> 13.)</p>
<p>In course of time the geographical signification of the name
came to be widely extended beyond its original limits. Just as
Philistia, the district of the Philistines, became the
comprehensive Palestine, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id=
"page42"></a>{42}</span> so Canaan, the land of the Canaanites of
the coast and the valley, came to denote the whole of the country
between the Jordan and the sea. It is already used in this sense in
the cuneiform correspondence of Tel el-Amarna. Already in the
century before the Exodus Kinakhna or Canaan represented pretty
nearly all that we now mean by "Palestine." It was in fact the
country to the south of "the land of the Amorites," and "the land
of the Amorites" lay immediately to the north of the Waters of
Merom.</p>
<p>In the geographical table in the tenth chapter of Genesis Canaan
is stated to be the son of Ham and the brother of Mizraim or Egypt.
The statement indicates the age to which the account must go back.
There was only one period of history in which Canaan could be
geographically described as a brother of Egypt, and that was the
period of the eighteenth and nineteenth dynasties, when for a while
it was a province of the Pharaohs. At no other time was it closely
connected with the sons of Ham. At an earlier epoch its relations
had been with Babylonia rather than with the valley of the Nile,
and with the fall of the nineteenth dynasty the Asiatic empire of
Egypt came finally to an end.</p>
<p>The city of Sidon, we are further told, was the first-born of
Canaan. It claimed to be the oldest of the Phoenician cities in the
"lowlands" of the coast. It had grown out of an assemblage of
"fishermen's" huts, and Said the god of the fishermen <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>{43}</span> continued to
preside over it to the last. The fishermen became in time sailors
and merchant-princes, and the fish for which they sought was the
murex with its precious purple dye. Tyre, the city of the "rock,"
which in later days disputed the supremacy over Phoenicia with
Sidon, was of younger foundation. Herodotus was told that the great
temple of Baal Melkarth, "the city's king," which he saw there, had
been built twenty-three centuries before his visit. But Sidon was
still older, older even than Gebal, the sacred city of the goddess
Baaltis.</p>
<p>The wider extension of the name of Canaan brought with it other
geographical relationships besides those of the sea-coast. Hittites
and Amorites, Jebusites and Girgashites, Hivites and the peoples of
the southern Lebanon, were all settled within the limits of the
larger Canaan, and were therefore accounted his sons. Even Hamath
claimed the right to be included in the brotherhood. It is said
with truth that "afterwards were the families of the Canaanites
spread abroad."</p>
<p>Hittites and Amorites were interlocked both in the north and in
the south. Kadesh, on the Orontes, the southern stronghold of the
Hittite kingdom of the north, was, as the Egyptian records tell us,
in the land of the Amorites; while in the south Hittites and
Amorites were mingled together at Hebron, and Ezekiel (xvi. 3)
declares that Jerusalem had a double parentage: its birth was in
the land of Canaan, but its father was an <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>{44}</span> Amorite and
its mother a Hittite. Modern research, however, has shown that
Hittites and Amorites were races widely separated in character and
origin. About the Hittites we hear a good deal both in the
hieroglyphic and in the cuneiform inscriptions. The Khata of the
Egyptian texts were the most formidable power of Western Asia with
whom the Egyptians of the eighteenth and nineteenth dynasties had
to deal. They were tribes of mountaineers from the ranges of the
Taurus who had descended on the plains of Syria and established
themselves there in the midst of an Aramaic population. Carchemish
on the Euphrates became one of their Syrian capitals, commanding
the high-road of commerce and war from east to west. Thothmes III.,
the conqueror of Western Asia, boasts of the gifts he received from
"the land of Khata the greater," so called, it would seem, to
distinguish it from another and lesser land of Khata&mdash;that of
the Hittites of the south.</p>
<p>The cuneiform tablets of Tel el-Amarna, in the closing days of
the eighteenth dynasty, represent the Hittites as advancing
steadily southward and menacing the Syrian possessions of the
Pharaoh. Disaffected Amorites and Canaanites looked to them for
help, and eventually "the land of the Amorites" to the north of
Palestine fell into their possession. When the first Pharaohs of
the nineteenth dynasty attempted to recover the Egyptian empire in
Asia, they found themselves confronted <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>{45}</span> by the most
formidable of antagonists. Against Kadesh and "the great king of
the Hittites" the Egyptian forces were driven in vain, and after
twenty years of warfare Ramses II., the Pharaoh of the Oppression,
was fain to consent to peace. A treaty of alliance, offensive and
defensive, was drawn up between the two rivals, and Egypt was
henceforth compelled to treat with the Hittites on equal terms. The
Khatt&acirc; or Khat&acirc; of the Assyrian inscriptions are
already a decaying power. They are broken into a number of separate
states or kingdoms, of which Carchemish is the richest and most
important. They are in fact in retreat towards those mountains of
Asia Minor from which they had originally issued forth. But they
still hold their ground in Syria for a long while. There were
Hittites at Kadesh in the reign of David. Hittite kings could lend
their services to Israel in the age of Elisha (2 Kings vii. 6), and
it was not till B.C. 717 that Carchemish was captured by Sargon of
Assyria, and the trade which passed through it diverted to Nineveh.
But when the Assyrians first became acquainted with the coastland
of the Mediterranean, the Hittites were to such an extent the
ruling race there that they gave their name to the whole district.
Like "Palestine," or "Canaan," the term "land of the Hittites" came
to denote among the Assyrians, not only Northern Syria and the
Lebanon, but Southern Syria as well. Even Ahab of Israel and Baasha
the Ammonite are included by Shalmaneser II. among its kings.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>{46}</span>
<p>This extended use of the name among the Assyrians is illustrated
by the existence of a Hittite tribe at Hebron in the extreme south
of Palestine. Various attempts have been made to get rid of the
latter by unbelieving critics, but the statements of Genesis are
corroborated by Ezekiel's account of the foundation of Jerusalem.
They are, moreover, in full harmony with the monumental records. As
we have seen, Thothmes III. implies that already in his day there
was a second and smaller land of the Hittites, and the great
Babylonian work on astronomy contains references to the Hittites
which appear to go back to early days.</p>
<p>Assyrian and Babylonian texts are not the only cuneiform records
which make mention of the "Khata" or Hittites. Their name is found
also on the monuments of the kings of Ararat or Armenia who reigned
in the ninth and eighth centuries before our era, and who had
borrowed from Nineveh the cuneiform system of writing. But the
Khata of these Vannic or Armenian texts lived considerably to the
north of the Hittites of the Bible and of the Egyptian and Assyrian
monuments. The country they inhabited lay in eastern Asia Minor in
the neighbourhood of the modern Malatiyeh. Here, in fact, was their
original home.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Egyptian artists, we are well acquainted with the
Hittite physical type. It was not handsome. The nose was unduly
protrusive, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id=
"page47"></a>{47}</span> while the chin and the forehead retreated.
The cheeks were square with prominent bones, and the face was
beardless. In colour the Hittites were yellow-skinned with black
hair and eyes. They seem to have worn their hair in three long
plaits which fell over the back like the pigtail of a Chinaman, and
they were distinguished by the use of boots with upturned toes.</p>
<p>We might perhaps imagine that the Egyptian artists have
caricatured their adversaries. But this is not the case. Precisely
the same profile of face, sometimes even exaggerated in its
ugliness, is represented on the Hittite monuments by the native
sculptors themselves. It is one of the surest proofs we possess
that these monuments, with their still undeciphered inscriptions,
are of Hittite origin. They belong to the people whom Israelites,
Egyptians, Assyrians, and Armenians united in calling Hittites.</p>
<p>In marked contrast to the Hittites stood the Amorites. They too
are depicted on the walls of the Egyptian temples and tombs. While
the Hittite type of features is Mongoloid, that of the Amorite is
European. His nose is straight and somewhat pointed, his lips and
nostrils thin, his cheek-bones high, his mouth firm and regular,
his forehead expressive of intelligence. He has a fair amount of
whisker, ending in a pointed beard. At Abu-Simbel the skin is
painted a pale yellow&mdash;the Egyptian equivalent for
white&mdash;his eyes blue, and his beard and eyebrows red. At
Med&icirc;net <span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id=
"page48"></a>{48}</span> Habu, his skin, as Prof. Petrie expresses
it, is "rather pinker than flesh-colour," while in a tomb of the
eighteenth dynasty at Thebes it is painted white, the eyes and hair
being a light red-brown.</p>
<p>The Amorite, it is clear, must be classed with the fair-skinned,
blue-eyed Libyans of the Egyptian monuments, whose modern
descendants are the Kabyles and other Berber tribes of Northern
Africa. The latter are not only European in type, they claim
special affinities to the blond, "golden-haired" Kelt. And their
tall stature agrees well with what the Old Testament has to tell us
about the Amorites. They too were classed among the Rephaim or
"giants," by the side of whom the Israelite invaders were but as
"grasshoppers."</p>
<p>While the Canaanites inhabited the lowlands, the highlands were
the seat of the Amorites (Num. xiii. 29). This, again, is in
accordance with their European affinities. They flourished best in
the colder and more bracing climate of the mountains, as do the
Berber tribes of Northern Africa to-day. The blond, blue-eyed race
is better adapted to endure the cold than the heat.</p>
<p>Amorite tribes and kingdoms were to be found in all parts of
Palestine. Southward, as we have seen, Kadesh-barnea was in "the
mountain of the Amorites," while Chedor-laomer found them on the
western shores of the Dead Sea. When Abraham pitched his tent in
the plain above Hebron, it was in the possession of three Amorite
chieftains, and at the time of the Israelitish conquest, Hebron
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>{49}</span>
and Jerusalem, Jarmuth, Lachish and Eglon were all Amorite (Josh.
x. 5). Jacob assured Joseph the inheritance of his tribe should be
in that district of Shechem which the patriarch had taken "out of
the hand of the Amorite" (Gen. xlviii. 22), and on the eastern side
of the Jordan were the Amorite kingdoms of Og and Sihon. But we
learn from the Egyptian inscriptions, and more especially from the
Tel el-Amarna tablets, that the chief seat of Amorite power lay
immediately to the north of Palestine. Here was "the land of the
Amorites," to which frequent reference is made by the monuments,
among the ranges of Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon, from Hamath southward
to Hermon. On the east it was bounded by the desert, on the west by
the cities of Phoenicia.</p>
<p>In early days, long before the age of Abraham, the Amorites must
already have been the predominant population in this part of Syria.
When the Babylonian king, Sargon of Akkad, carried his victorious
arms to the shores of the Mediterranean, it was against "the land
of the Amorites" that his campaigns were directed. From that time
forward this was the name under which Syria, and more particularly
Canaan, was known to the Babylonians. The geographical extension of
the term was parallel to that of "Hittites" among the Assyrians, of
"Canaan" among the Israelites, and of "Palestine" among ourselves.
But it bears witness to the important part which was played by the
Amorites in what we must still call the prehistoric age of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>{50}</span>
Syria, as well as to the extent of the area which they must have
occupied.</p>
<p>Of course it does not follow that the whole of this area was
occupied at one and the same time. Indeed we know that the conquest
of the northern portion of Moab by the Amorite king Sihon took
place only a short time before the Israelitish invasion, and part
of the Amorite song of triumph on the occasion has been preserved
in the Book of Numbers. "There is a fire gone out of Heshbon," it
said, "a flame from the city of Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab,
and the lords of the high places of Arnon. Woe to thee, Moab! thou
art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath given his sons that
escaped, and his daughters, into captivity unto Sihon king of the
Amorites." (Num. xxi. 28, 29.) In the south, again, the Amorites do
not seem to have made their way beyond Hazezon-Tamar, while the Tel
el-Amarna tablets make it probable that neither Bashan nor
Jerusalem were as yet Amorite at the time they were written. It may
be that the Amorite conquests in the south were one of the results
of the fall of the Egyptian empire and the Hittite irruption.</p>
<p>Between the Hittite and the Amorite the geographical table of
Genesis interposes the Jebusite, and the Book of Numbers similarly
states that "the Hittites and the Jebusites and the Amorites dwell
in the mountains." The Jebusites, however, were merely the local
tribe which in the early days <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page51" id="page51"></a>{51}</span> of the Israelitish occupation
of Canaan were in possession of Jerusalem, and they were probably
either Hittite or Amorite in race. At any rate there is no trace of
them in the cuneiform letters of Tel el-Amarna. On the contrary, in
these Jerusalem is still known only by its old name of Uru-salim;
of the name Jebus there is not a hint. But the letters show us that
Ebed-Tob, the native king of Jerusalem and humble vassal of the
Pharaoh, was being hard pressed by his enemies, and that, in spite
of his urgent appeals for help, the Egyptians were unable to send
any. His enemy were the Khabiri or "Confederates," about whose
identification there has been much discussion, but who were
assisted by the Beduin chief Labai and his sons. One by one the
towns belonging to the territory of Jerusalem fell into the hands
of his adversaries, and at last, as we learn from another letter,
Ebed-Tob himself along with his capital was captured by the foe. It
was this event, perhaps, which made Jerusalem a Jebusite city. If
so, we must see in the enemies of Ebed-Tob the Jebusites of the Old
Testament.</p>
<p>The Girgashite is named after the Amorite, but who he may have
been it is hard to say. In the Egyptian epic composed by the
court-poet Pentaur, to commemorate the heroic deeds of Ramses II.
in his struggle with the Hittites, mention is twice made of "the
country of Qarqish." It was one of those which had sent contingents
to the Hittite army. But it seems to have been situated in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>{52}</span>
Northern Syria, if not in Asia Minor, so that unless we can suppose
that some of its inhabitants had followed in the wake of the
Hittites and settled in Palestine, it is not easy to see how they
could be included among the sons of Canaan. The Hivites, whose name
follows that of the Girgashites, are simply the "villagers" or
fellahin as opposed to the townsfolk. They are thus synonymous with
the Perizzites, who take their place in Gen. xv. 20, and whose name
has the same signification. But whereas the Perizzites were
especially the country population of Southern Palestine, the
Hivites were those of the north. In two passages, indeed, the name
appears to be used in an ethnic sense, once in Gen. xxxvi. 2, where
we read that Esau married the granddaughter of "Zibeon the Hivite,"
and once in Josh. xi. 3, where reference is made to "the Hivite
under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh." But a comparison of the first
passage with a later part of the chapter (vv. 20, 24, 25) proves
that "Hivite" is a corrupt reading for "Horite," while it is
probable that in the second passage "Hittite" ought to be read for
"Hivite."</p>
<p>The four last sons of Canaan represent cities, and not tribes.
Arka, called Irqat in the Tel el-Amarna tablets, and now known as
Tel 'Arqa, was one of the inland cities of Phoenicia, in the
mountains between the Orontes and the sea. Sin, which is mentioned
by Tiglath-pileser III., was in the same neighbourhood, as well as
Zemar (now Sumra), which, like Arvad (the modern Ru&acirc;d), is
named repeatedly <span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id=
"page53"></a>{53}</span> in the Tel el-Amarna correspondence. It
was at the time an important Phoenician fortress,&mdash;"perched
like a bird upon the rock,"&mdash;and was under the control of the
governor of Gebal. Arvad was equally important as a sea-port, and
its ships were used for war as well as for commerce. As for Hamath
(now Hamah), the Khamat and Amat of the Assyrian texts, it was
already a leading city in the days of the eighteenth Egyptian
dynasty. Thothmes III. includes it among his Syrian conquests under
the name of Amatu, as also does Ramses III. The Hittite
inscriptions discovered there go to show that, like Kadesh on the
Orontes, it fell at one time into Hittite hands.</p>
<p>Such then was the ethnographical map of Palestine in the
Patriarchal Age. Canaanites in the lowlands, Amorites and Hittites
in the highlands contended for the mastery. In the desert of the
south were the Amalekite Beduin, ever ready to raid and murder
their settled neighbours. The mountains of Seir were occupied by
the Horites, while prehistoric tribes, who probably belonged to the
Amorite race, inhabited the plateau east of the Jordan.</p>
<p>This was the Palestine to which Abraham migrated, but it was a
Palestine which his migration was destined eventually to change.
Before many generations had passed Moab and Ammon, the children of
his nephew, took the place of the older population of the eastern
table-land, while Edom settled in Mount Seir. A few generations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>{54}</span>
more, and Israel too entered into its inheritance in Canaan itself.
The Amorites were extirpated or became tributary, and the valleys
of the Jordan and Kishon were seized by the invading tribes. The
cities of the extreme south had already become Philistine, and the
strangers from Caphtor had supplanted in them the Avim of an
earlier epoch.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the waves of foreign conquest had spread more than
once across the country. Canaan had been made subject to Babylonia,
and had received in exchange for its independence the gift of
Babylonian culture. Next it was Egypt which entered upon its career
of Asiatic conquest, and Canaan for a while was an Egyptian
province. But the Egyptian dominion in its turn passed away, and
Palestine was left the prey of other assailants, of the Hittites
and the Beduin, of the people of Aram Naharaim and the northern
hordes. Egyptians and Babylonians, Hittites and Mesopotamians
mingled with the earlier races of the country and obliterated the
older landmarks. Before the Patriarchal Age came to an end, the
ethnographical map of Canaan had undergone a profound change.</p>

<h2><a name="chap3" id="chap3">CHAPTER III</a></h2>
<h3>THE BABYLONIANS IN CANAAN AND THE EGYPTIAN CONQUEST</h3>
<p>It is in the cuneiform records of Babylonia that we catch the
first glimpse of the early history of Canaan. Babylonia was not yet
united under a single head. From time to time some prince arose
whose conquests allowed him to claim the imperial title of "king of
Sumer and Akkad," of Southern and Northern Babylonia, but the claim
was never of long duration, and often it signified no more than a
supremacy over the other rulers of the country.</p>
<p>It was while Babylonia was thus divided into more than one
kingdom, that the first Chald&aelig;an empire of which we know was
formed by the military skill of Sargon of Akkad. Sargon was of
Semitic origin, but his birth seems to have been obscure. His
father, Itti-Bel, is not given the title of king, and the later
legends which gathered around his name declared that his mother was
of low degree, that his father he knew not, and that his father's
brother lived in the mountain-land. Born in secrecy in the city of
Azu-pirani, "whence <span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id=
"page56"></a>{56}</span> the elephants issue forth," he was
launched by his mother on the waters of the Euphrates in an ark of
bulrushes daubed with pitch. The river carried the child to Akki
the irrigator, who had compassion upon it, and brought it up as his
own son. So Sargon became an agriculturist and gardener like his
adopted father, till the goddess Istar beheld and loved him, and
eventually gave him his kingdom and crown.</p>
<p>Whatever may have been the real history of Sargon's rise to
power, certain it is that he showed himself worthy of it. He built
himself a capital, which perhaps was Akkad near Sippara, and there
founded a library stocked with books on clay and well provided with
scribes. The standard works on astronomy and terrestrial omens were
compiled for it, the first of which was translated into Greek by
Berossos in days long subsequent. But it was as a conqueror and the
founder of the first Semitic empire in Western Asia that posterity
chiefly remembered him. He overthrew his rivals at home, and made
himself master of Northern Babylonia. Then he marched into Elam on
the east, and devastated its fields. Next he turned his attention
to the west. Four times did he make his way to "the land of the
Amorites," until at last it was thoroughly subdued. His final
campaign occupied three years. The countries "of the sea of the
setting sun" acknowledged his dominion, and he united them with his
former conquests into "a single" empire. On the shores of the
Mediterranean <span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id=
"page57"></a>{57}</span> he erected images of himself in token of
his victories, and caused the spoil of Cyprus "to pass over into
the countries of the sea." Towards the end of his reign a revolt
broke out against him in Babylonia, and he was besieged in the city
of Akkad, but he "issued forth and smote" his enemies and utterly
destroyed them. Then came his last campaign against Northern
Mesopotamia, from which he returned with abundant prisoners and
spoil.</p>
<p>Sargon's son and successor was Naram-Sin, "the beloved of the
Moon-god," who continued the conquests of his father. His second
campaign was against the land of Magan, the name under which Midian
and the Sinaitic peninsula were known to the Babylonians. The
result of it was the addition of Magan to his empire and the
captivity of its king.</p>
<p>The copper mines of Magan, which are noticed in an early
Babylonian geographical list, made its acquisition coveted alike by
Babylonians and Egyptians. We find the Pharaohs of the third
dynasty already establishing their garrisons and colonies of miners
in the province of Mafkat, as they called it, and slaughtering the
Beduin who interfered with them. The history of Naram-Sin shows
that its conquest was equally an object of the Babylonian monarchs
at the very outset of their history. But whereas the road from
Egypt to Sinai was short and easy, that from Babylonia was long and
difficult. Before a Babylonian army <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page58" id="page58"></a>{58}</span> could march into the peninsula
it was needful that Syria should be secure in the rear. The
conquest of Palestine, in fact, was necessary before the copper
mines of Sinai could fall into Babylonian hands.</p>
<p>The consolidation of Sargon's empire in the west, therefore, was
needful before the invasion of the country of Magan could take
place, and the invasion accordingly was reserved for Naram-Sin to
make. The father had prepared the way; the son obtained the great
prize&mdash;the source of the copper that was used in the ancient
world.</p>
<p>The fact that the whole of Syria is described in the annals of
Sargon as "the land of the Amorites," implies, not only that the
Amorites were the ruling population in the country, but also that
they must have extended far to the south. The "land of the
Amorites" formed the basis and starting-point for the expedition of
Naram-Sin into Magan; it must, therefore, have reached to the
southern border of Palestine, if not even farther. The road trodden
by his forces would have been the same as that which was afterwards
traversed by Chedor-laomer, and would have led him through
Kadesh-barnea. Is it possible that the Amorites were already in
possession of the mountain-block within which Kadesh stood, and
that this was their extreme limit to the south?</p>
<p>There were other names by which Palestine and Syria were known
to the early Babylonians, besides the general title of "the land of
the Amorites." <span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id=
"page59"></a>{59}</span> One of these was Tidanum or Tidnum;
another was Sanir or Shenir. There was yet another, the reading of
which is uncertain, though it may be Khidhi or Titi.</p>
<p>Mr. Boscawen has pointed out a coincidence that is at least
worthy of attention. The first Babylonian monarch who penetrated
into the peninsula of Sinai bore a name compounded with that of the
Moon-god, which thus bears witness to a special veneration for that
deity. Now the name of Mount Sinai is similarly derived from that
of the Babylonian Moon-god Sin. It was the high place where the god
must have been adored from early times under his Babylonian name.
It thus points to Babylonian influence, if not to the presence of
Babylonians on the spot. Can it have been that the mountain whereon
the God of Israel afterwards revealed Himself to Moses was
dedicated to the Moon-god of Babylon by Naram-Sin the Chald&aelig;n
conqueror?</p>
<p>If such indeed were the case, it would have been more than two
thousand years before the Israelitish exodus. Nabonidos, the last
king of the later Babylonian empire, who had a fancy for
antiquarian exploration, tells us that Naram-Sin reigned 3200 years
before his own time, and therefore about 3750 B.C. The date,
startlingly early as it seems to be, is indirectly confirmed by
other evidence, and Assyriologists consequently have come to accept
it as approximately correct.</p>
<p>How long Syria remained a part of the empire <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>{60}</span> of Sargon of
Akkad we do not know. But it must have been long enough for the
elements of Babylonian culture to be introduced into it. The small
stone cylinders used by the Babylonians for sealing their clay
documents thus became known to the peoples of the West. More than
one has been found in Syria and Cyprus which go back to the age of
Sargon and Naram-Sin, while there are numerous others which are
more or less barbarous attempts on the part of the natives to
imitate the Babylonian originals. But the imitations prove that
with the fall of Sargon's empire the use of seal-cylinders in
Syria, and consequently of documents for sealing, did not
disappear. That knowledge of writing, which was a characteristic of
Babylonian civilization, must have been carried with it to the
shores of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>The seal-cylinders were engraved, sometimes with figures of men
and gods, sometimes with symbols only. Very frequently lines of
cuneiform writing were added, and a common formula gave the name of
the owner of the seal, along with those of his father and of the
deity whom he worshipped. One of the seal-cylinders found in Cyprus
describes the owner as an adorer of "the god Naram-Sin." It is true
that its workmanship shows it to belong to a much later date than
the age of Naram-Sin himself, but the legend equally shows that the
name of the conqueror of Magan was still remembered in the West.
Another cylinder discovered in the Lebanon mentions "the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>{61}</span>
gods of the Amorite," while a third from the same locality bears
the inscription: "Multal-ili, the son of Ili-isme-anni, the
worshipper of the god Nin-si-zida." The name of the god signified
in the old pre-Semitic language of Chald&aelig;a "the lord of the
upright horn," while it is worth notice that the names of the owner
and his father are compounded simply with the word <i>ili</i> or
<i>el</i>, "god," not with the name of any special divinity.
Multal-ili means "Provident is God," Ili-isme-anni, "O my God, hear
me!"</p>
<p>Many centuries have to elapse before the monuments of Babylonia
again throw light on the history of Canaan. Somewhere about B.C.
2700, a high-priest was ruling in a city of Southern Babylonia,
under the suzerainty of Dungi, the king of Ur. The high-priest's
name was Gudea, and his city (now called Tel-loh by the Arabs) was
known as Lagas. The excavations made here by M. de Sarzec have
brought to light temples and palaces, collections of clay books and
carved stone statues, which go back to the early days of Babylonian
history. The larger and better part of the monuments belong to
Gudea, who seems to have spent most of his life in building and
restoring the sanctuaries of the gods. Diorite statues of the
prince are now in the Louvre, and inscriptions upon them state that
the stone out of which they were made was brought from the land of
Magan. On the lap of one of them is a plan of the royal palace,
with the scale of measurement marked on <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>{62}</span> the edge of
a sort of drawing-board. Prof. Petrie has shown that the unit of
measurement represented in it is the cubit of the pyramid-builders
of Egypt.</p>
<p>The diorite of Sinai was not the only material which was
imported into Babylonia for the buildings of Gudea. Beams of cedar
and box were brought from Mount Amanus at the head of the Gulf of
Antioch, blocks of stone were floated down the Euphrates from
Barsip near Carchemish, gold-dust came from Melukhkha, the "salt"
desert to the east of Egypt which the Old Testament calls Havilah;
copper was conveyed from the north of Arabia, limestone from the
Lebanon ("the mountains of Tidanum"), and another kind of stone
from Subsalla in the mountains of the Amorite land. Before beams of
wood and blocks of stone could thus be brought from the distant
West, it was necessary that trade between Babylonia and the
countries of the Mediterranean should have long been organized,
that the roads throughout Western Asia should have been good and
numerous, and that Babylonian influence should have been extended
far and wide. The conquests of Sargon and Naram-Sin had borne fruit
in the commerce that had followed upon them.</p>
<p>Once more the curtain falls, and Canaan is hidden for a while
out of our sight. Babylonia has become a united kingdom with its
capital and centre at Babylon. Khammurabi (B.C. 2356-2301) has
succeeded in shaking off the suzerainty of <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>{63}</span> Elam, in
overthrowing his rival Eri-Aku, king of Larsa, with his Elamite
allies, and in constituting himself sole monarch of Babylonia. His
family seems to have been in part, if not wholly, of South Arabian
extraction. Their names are Arabian rather than Babylonian, and the
Babylonian scribes found a difficulty in transcribing them
correctly. But once in the possession of the Babylonian throne,
they became thoroughly national, and under Khammurabi the literary
glories of the court of Sargon of Akkad revived once more.</p>
<p>Ammi-satana, the great-grandson of Khammurabi, calls himself
king of "the land of the Amorites." Babylonia, therefore, still
claimed to be paramount in Palestine. Even the name of the king is
an indication of his connection with the West. Neither of the
elements of which it is composed belonged to the Babylonian
language. The first of them, Ammi, was explained by the Babylonian
philologists as meaning "a family," but it is more probable that it
represents the name of a god. We find it in the proper names both
of Southern and of Northwestern Arabia. The early Minsaean
inscriptions of Southern Arabia contain names like Ammi-karib,
Ammi-zadiqa, and Ammi-zaduq, the last of which is identical with
that of Ammi-zaduq, the son and successor of Ammi-satana. The
Egyptian Sinuhit, who in the time of the twelfth dynasty fled, like
Moses, for his life from the court of the Pharaoh to the Kadmonites
east of the Jordan, found protection among them at the hands of
their chieftain Ammu-&acirc;nshi. <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page64" id="page64"></a>{64}</span> The Ammonites themselves were
the "sons of Ammi," and in numerous Hebrew names we find that of
the god. Ammi-el, Ammi-nadab, and Ammi-shaddai are mentioned in the
Old Testament, the Assyrian inscriptions tell us of Ammi-nadab the
king of Ammon, and it is possible that even the name of Balaam, the
Aramaean seer, may be compounded with that of the god. At all
events, the city of Pethor from which he came was "by the river
(Euphrates) of the land of the children of Ammo," for such is the
literal rendering of the Hebrew words.</p>
<p>Ammi-satana was not the first of his line whose authority had
been acknowledged in Palestine. The inscription in which he records
the fact is but a confirmation of what had been long known to us
from the Book of Genesis. There we read how Chedor-laomer, the king
of Elam, with the three vassal princes, Arioch of Ellasar, Amraphel
of Shinar, and Tidal of Goyyim invaded Canaan, and how the kings of
the vale of Siddim with its pits of asphalt became their
tributaries. For thirteen years they remained submissive and then
rebelled. Thereupon the Babylonian army again marched to the west.
Bashan and the eastern bank of the Jordan were subjugated, the
Horites in Mount Seir were smitten, and the invaders then turned
back through Kadesh-barnea, overthrowing the Amalekites and the
Amorites on their way. Then came the battle in the vale of Siddim,
which ended in the defeat of the Canaanites, the death of the kings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>{65}</span>
of Sodom and Gomorrha, and the capture of abundant booty. Among the
prisoners was Lot, the nephew of Abram, and it was to effect his
rescue that the patriarch armed his followers and started in
pursuit of the conquerors. Near Damascus he overtook them, and
falling upon them by night, recovered the spoil of Sodom as well as
his "brother's son."</p>
<p>Arioch is the Eri-Aku of the cuneiform texts. In the old
language of Chaldea the name signified "servant of the Moon-god."
The king is well known to us from contemporaneous inscriptions.
Besides the inscribed bricks which have come from the temple of the
Moon-god which he enlarged in the city of Ur, there are numerous
contract tablets that are dated in his reign. He tells us that he
was the son of an Elamite, Kudur-Mabug, son of Simti-silkhak, and
prince (or "father") of Yamut-bal on the borders of Elam and
Babylonia. But this is not all. He further gives Kudur-Mabug the
title of "father of the Amorite land." What this title exactly
means it is difficult to say; one thing, however, is certain,
Kudur-Mabug must have exercised some kind of power and authority in
the distant West.</p>
<p>His name, too, is remarkable. Names compounded with Kudur, "a
servant," were common in the Elamite language, the second element
of the name being that of a deity, to whose worship the owner of it
was dedicated. Thus we have Kudur-Lagamar, "the servant of the god
Lagamar," Kudur-Nakhkhunte, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page66"
id="page66"></a>{66}</span> "the servant of Nakhkhunte." But Mabug
was not an Elamite divinity. It was, on the contrary, a
Mesopotamian deity from whom the town of Mabug near Carchemish,
called Bambyk&ecirc; by the Greeks, and assimilated by the Arabs to
their Membij, "a source," derived its name. Can it be from this
Syrian deity that the father of Arioch received his name?</p>
<p>The capital of Arioch or Eri-Aku was Larsa, the city of the
Sun-god, now called Senkereh. With the help of his Elamite kindred,
he extended his power from thence over the greater part of Southern
Babylonia. The old city of Ur, once the seat of the dominant
dynasty of Chald&aelig;an kings, formed part of his dominions;
Nipur, now Niffer, fell into his hands like the seaport Eridu on
the shores of the Persian Gulf, and in one of his inscriptions he
celebrates his conquest of "the ancient city of Erech." On the day
of its capture he erected in gratitude a temple to his god
Ingirisa, "for the preservation of his life."</p>
<p>But the god did not protect him for ever. A time came when
Khammurabi, king of Babylon, rose in revolt against the Elamite
supremacy, and drove the Elamite forces out of the land. Eri-Aku
was attacked and defeated, and his cities fell into the hands of
the conqueror. Khammurabi became sole king of Babylonia, which from
henceforth obeyed but a single sceptre.</p>
<p>Are we to see in the Amraphel of Genesis the Khammurabi of the
cuneiform inscriptions? The <span class="pagenum"><a name="page67"
id="page67"></a>{67}</span> difference in the names seems to make
it impossible. Moreover, Amraphel, we are told, was king of Shinar,
and it is not certain that the Shinar of the fourteenth chapter of
Genesis was that part of Babylonia of which Babylon was the
capital. This, in fact, was the northern division of the country,
and if we are to identify the Shinar of scripture with the Sumer of
the monuments, as Assyriologists have agreed to do, Shinar would
have been its southern half. It is true that in the later days of
Hebrew history Shinar denoted the whole plain of Chald&aelig;a,
including the city of Babylon, but this may have been an extension
of the meaning of the name similar to that of which Canaan is an
instance.</p>
<p>Unless Sumer and Shinar are the same words, outside the Old
Testament there is only one Shinar known to ancient geography. That
was in Mesopotamia. The Greek geographers called it Singara (now
Sinjar), an oasis in the midst of deserts, and formed by an
isolated mountain tract abounding in springs. It is already
mentioned in the annals of the Egyptian conqueror Thothmes III. In
his thirty-third year (B.C. 1470), the king of Sangar sent him
tribute consisting of lapis-lazuli "of Babylon," and of various
objects carved out of it. From Sangar also horses were exported
into Egypt, and in one of the Tel el-Amarna letters, the king of
Alasiya in Northern Syria writes to the Pharaoh,&mdash;"Do not set
me with the king of the Hittites and the king of Sankhar; whatever
gifts they have <span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id=
"page68"></a>{68}</span> sent to me I will restore to thee
twofold." In hieroglyphic and cuneiform spelling, Sangar and
Sankhar are the exact equivalents of the Hebrew Shinar.</p>
<p>How the name of Shinar came to be transferred from Mesopotamia
to Babylonia is a puzzle. The Mesopotamian Shinar is nowhere near
the Babylonian frontier. It lies in a straight line westward of
Mosul and the ancient Nineveh, and not far from the banks of the
Khabur. Can its application to Babylonia be due to a confusion
between Sumer and Sangar?</p>
<p>Whatever the explanation may be, it is clear that the position
of the kingdom of Amraphel is by no means so easily determined as
has hitherto been supposed. It may be Sumer or Southern Babylonia;
it may be Northern Babylonia with its capital Babylon; or again, it
may be the Mesopotamian oasis of Sinjar. Until we find the name of
Amraphel in the cuneiform texts it is impossible to attain
certainty.</p>
<p>There is one fact, however, which seems to indicate that it
really is either Sumer or Northern Babylonia that is meant. The
narrative of Chedor-laomer's campaign begins with the words that it
took place "in the time of Amraphel, king of Shinar." Chedor-laomer
the Elamite was the leader of the expedition; he too was the
suzerain lord of his allies; and nevertheless the campaign is
dated, not in his reign, but in that of one of the subject kings.
That the narrative has been taken from the Babylonian annals there
is little room for <span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id=
"page69"></a>{69}</span> doubt, and consequently it would follow
from the dating that Amraphel was a Babylonian prince, perhaps that
he was the ruler of the city which, from the days of Khammurabi
onward, became the capital of the country. In that case we should
have to find some way of explaining the difference between the
Hebrew and the Babylonian forms of the royal name.</p>
<p>Lagamar or Lagamer, written Laomer in Hebrew, was one of the
principal deities of Elam, and the Babylonians made him a son of
their own water-god Ea. The Elamite king Chedor-laomer, or
Kudur-Lagamar, as his name was written in his own language, must
have been related to the Elamite prince Kudur-Mabug, whose son
Arioch was a subject-ally of the Elamite monarch. Possibly they
were brothers, the younger brother receiving as his share of power
the title of "father"&mdash;not "king"&mdash;of Yamutbal and the
land of the Amorites. At any rate it is a son of Kudur-Mabug and
not of the Elamite sovereign who receives a principality in
Babylonia.</p>
<p>In the Book of Genesis Arioch is called "king of Ellasar." But
Ellasar is clearly the Larsa of the cuneiform inscriptions, perhaps
with the word <i>al</i>, "city," prefixed. Larsa, the modern
Senkereh, was in Southern Babylonia, on the eastern bank of the
Euphrates, not far from Erech, and to the north of Ur. Its king was
virtually lord of Sumer, but he claimed to be lord also of the
north. In his inscriptions Eri-Aku assumes the imperial title of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>{70}</span>
"king of Sumer and Akkad," of both divisions of Babylonia, and it
may be that at one time the rival king of Babylon acknowledged his
supremacy.</p>
<p>Who "Tidal king of Goyyim" may have been we cannot tell. Sir
Henry Rawlinson has proposed to see in Goyyim a transformation of
Gutium, the name by which Kurdistan was called in early Babylonia.
Mr. Pinches has recently discovered a cuneiform tablet in which
mention is made, not only of Eri-Aku and Kudur-Lagamar, but also of
Tudkhul, and Tudkhul would be an exact transcription in Babylonian
of the Hebrew Tidal. But the tablet is mutilated, and its relation
to the narrative of Genesis is not yet clear. For the present,
therefore, we must leave Tidal unexplained.</p>
<p>The name even of one of the Canaanite kings who were subdued by
the Babylonian army has found its confirmation in a cuneiform
inscription. This is the name of "Shinab, king of Admah." We hear
from Tiglath-pileser III. of Sanibu, king of Ammon, and Sanibu and
Shinab are one and the same. The old name of the king of Admah was
thus perpetuated on the eastern side of the Jordan.</p>
<p>It may be that the asphalt of Siddim was coveted by the
Babylonian kings. Bitumen, it is true, was found in Babylonia
itself near Hit, but if Amiaud is right, one of the objects
imported from abroad for Gudea of Lagas was asphalt. It came from
Madga, which is described as being "in the mountains of the river
Gur(?)ruda." But no reference to <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page71" id="page71"></a>{71}</span> the place is to be met with
anywhere else in cuneiform literature.</p>
<p>When Abram returned with the captives and spoil of Sodom, the
new king came forth to meet him "at the valley of Shaveh, which is
the king's dale." This was in the near neighbourhood of Jerusalem,
as we gather from the history of Absalom (2 Sam. xviii. 18).
Accordingly we further read that at the same time "Melchizedek,
king of Salem," and "priest of the most High God," "brought forth
bread and wine," and blessed the Hebrew conqueror, who thereupon
gave him tithes of all the spoil.</p>
<p>It is only since the discovery and decipherment of the cuneiform
tablets of Tel el-Amarna that the story of Melchizedek has been
illustrated and explained. Hitherto it had seemed to stand alone.
The critics, in the superiority of their knowledge, had refused
credit to it, and had denied that the name even of Jerusalem or
Salem was known before the age of David. But the monuments have
come to our help, and have shown that it is the critics and not the
Biblical writer who have been in error.</p>
<p>Several of the most interesting of the Tel el-Amarna letters
were written to the Pharaoh Amen&ocirc;phis IV. Khu-n-Aten by
Ebed-Tob the king of Jerusalem. Not only is the name of Uru-salim
or Jerusalem the only one in use, the city itself is already one of
the most important fortresses of Canaan. It was the capital of a
large district which extended southwards as far as Keilah
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>{72}</span>
and Karmel of Judah. It commanded the approach to the vale of
Siddim, and in one of his letters Ebed-Tob speaks of having
repaired the royal roads not only in the mountains, but also in the
<i>kikar</i> or "plain" of Jordan (Gen. xiii. 10). The possession
of Jerusalem was eagerly coveted by the enemies of Ebed-Tob, whom
he calls also the enemies of the Egyptian king.</p>
<p>Now Ebed-Tob declares time after time that he is not an Egyptian
governor, but a tributary ally and vassal of the Pharaoh, and that
he had received his royal power, not by inheritance from his father
or mother, but through the arm (or oracle) of "the Mighty King." As
"the Mighty King" is distinguished from the "great King" of Egypt,
we must see in him the god worshipped by Ebed-Tob, the "Most High
God" of Melchizedek, and the prototype of "the Mighty God" of
Isaiah. It is this same mighty king, Ebed-Tob assures the Pharaoh
in another letter, who will overthrow the navies of Babylonia and
Aram-Naharaim.</p>
<p>Here, then, as late as the fifteenth century before our era we
have a king of Jerusalem who owes his royal dignity to his god. He
is, in fact, a priest as well as a king. His throne has not
descended to him by inheritance; so far as his kingly office is
concerned, he is like Melchizedek, without father and without
mother. Between Ebed-Tob and Melchizedek there is more than
analogy; there is a striking and unexpected resemblance. The
description given of him by Ebed-Tob explains <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>{73}</span> what has
puzzled us so long in the person of Melchizedek.</p>
<p>The origin of the name of Jerusalem also is now cleared up. It
was no invention of the age of David; on the contrary, it goes back
to the period of Babylonian intercourse with Canaan. It is written
in the cuneiform documents Uru-Salim, "the city of Salim," the god
of peace. One of the lexical tablets from the library of Nineveh
has long ago informed us that in one of the languages known to the
Babylonians <i>uru</i> was the equivalent of the Babylonian
<i>alu</i>, "a city," and we now know that this language was that
of Canaan. It would even seem that the word had originally been
brought from Babylonia itself in the days when Babylonian writing
and culture first penetrated to the West. In the Sumerian or
pre-Semitic language of Chald&aelig;a <i>eri</i> signified a
"city," and <i>eri</i> in the pronunciation of the Semites became
<i>uru</i>. Hence it was that Uru or Ur, the birthplace of Abraham,
received its name at a time when it was the ruling city of
Babylonia, and though the Semitic Babylonians themselves never
adopted the word in common life it made its way to Canaan. The rise
of the "city" in the west was part of that Babylonian civilization
which was carried to the shores of the Mediterranean, and so the
word which denoted it was borrowed from the old language of
Chald&aelig;a, like the word for "palace,"
<i>h&ecirc;k&acirc;l</i>, the Sumerian <i>&ecirc;-gal</i>, or
"Great House." It is noteworthy that Harran, the resting-place of
Abraham on his way <span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id=
"page74"></a>{74}</span> from Ur to Palestine, the half-way house,
as it were, between East and West, also derived its name from a
Sumerian word which signified "the high-road." <i>Harran</i> and
<i>Ur</i> were two of the gifts which passed to Canaan from the
speakers of the primaeval language of Chald&aelig;a.</p>
<p>We can now understand why Melchizedek should have been called
the "king of Salem." His capital could be described either as
Jeru-salem or as the city of Salem. And that it was often referred
to as Salem simply is shown by the Egyptian monuments. One of the
cities of Southern Palestine, the capture of which is represented
by Ramses II. on the walls of the Ramesseum at Thebes, is Shalam or
Salem, and "the district of Salem" is mentioned between "the
country of Hadashah" (Josh. xv. 37) and "the district of the Dead
Sea" and "the Jordan," in the list of the places which Ramses III.
at Med&icirc;net Habu describes himself as having conquered in the
same part of the world.</p>
<p>It may be that Isaiah is playing upon the old name of Jerusalem
when he gives the Messiah the title of "Prince of Peace." But in
any case the fact that Salim, the god of peace, was the patron
deity of Jerusalem, lends a special significance to Melchizedek's
treatment of Abram. The patriarch had returned in peace from an
expedition in which he had overthrown the invaders of Canaan; he
had restored peace to the country of the priest-king, and had
driven away its enemies. The offering <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>{75}</span> of bread and
wine on the part of Melchizedek was a sign of freedom from the
enemy and of gratitude to the deliverer, while the tithes paid by
Abram were equally a token that the land was again at peace. The
name of Salim, the god of peace, was under one form or another
widely spread in the Semitic world. Salamanu, or Solomon, was the
king of Moab in the time of Tiglath-pileser III.; the name of
Shalmaneser of Assyria is written Sulman-asarid, "the god Sulman is
chief," in the cuneiform inscriptions; and one of the Tel el-Amarna
letters was sent by Ebed-Sullim, "the servant of Sullim," who was
governor of Hazor. In one of the Assyrian cities (Dimmen-Silim,
"the foundation-stone of peace") worship was paid to the god
"Sulman the fish." Nor must we forget that "Salma was the father of
Beth-lehem" (1 Chron. ii. 51).</p>
<p>In the time of the Israelitish conquest the king of Jerusalem
was Adoni-zedek (Josh. x. 1). The name is similar to that of
Melchi-zedek, though the exact interpretation of it is a matter of
doubt. It points, however, to a special use of the word
<i>zedek</i>, "righteousness," and it is therefore interesting to
find the word actually employed in one of the letters of Ebed-Tob.
He there says of the Pharaoh: "Behold, the king is righteous
(<i>zaduq</i>) towards me." What makes the occurrence of the word
the more striking is that it was utterly unknown to the
Babylonians. The root <i>zadaq</i>, "to be righteous," did not
exist in the Assyrian language.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>{76}</span>
<p>There is yet another point in the history of the meeting between
Abram and Melchizedek which must not be passed over. When the
patriarch returned after smiting the invading army he was met
outside Jerusalem not only by Melchizedek, but also by the new king
of Sodom. It was, therefore, in the mountains and in the shadow of
the sanctuary of the Most High God that the newly-appointed prince
was to be found, rather than in the vale of Siddim. Does not this
show that the king of Jerusalem already exercised that sovereignty
over the surrounding district that Ebed-Tob did in the century
before the Exodus? As we have seen, Ebed-Tob describes himself as
repairing the roads in that very "Kikar," or "plain," in which
Sodom and Gomorrha stood. It would seem then that the priest-king
of the great fortress in the mountains was already acknowledged as
the dominant Canaanitish ruler, and that the neighbouring princes
had to pay him homage when they first received the crown. This
would be an additional reason for the tithes given to him by
Abram.</p>
<p>Long after the defeat of Chedor-laomer and his allies, if we are
to accept the traditional belief, Abraham was again destined to
visit Jerusalem. But he had ceased to be "Abram the Hebrew," the
confederate of the Amorite chieftains in the plain of Mamre, and
had become Abraham the father of the promised seed. Isaac had been
born to him, and he was called upon to sacrifice his first-born
son.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>{77}</span>
<p>The place of sacrifice was upon one of the mountains in the land
of Moriah. There at the last moment the hand of the father was
stayed, and a ram was substituted for the human victim. "And
Abraham called the name of that place Yahveh-yireh; as it is said
to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen." According
to the Hebrew text of the Chronicles (2 Chron. iii. 1), this mount
of the Lord where Abraham's sacrifice was offered was the
temple-mount at Jerusalem. The proverb quoted in Genesis seems to
indicate the same fact. Moreover, the distance of the mountain from
Beer-sheba&mdash;three days' journey&mdash;would be also the
distance of Jerusalem from Abraham's starting-place.</p>
<p>It is even possible that in the name of Yahveh-yireh we have a
play upon the first element in the name of Jeru-salem. The word
<i>uru</i>, "city," became <i>yeru</i> or <i>yiru</i> in Hebrew
pronunciation, and between this and <i>yireh</i> the difference is
not great. Yahveh-yireh, "the Lord sees," might also be interpreted
"the Lord of Yeru."</p>
<p>The temple-hill was emphatically "the mount of the Lord." In
Ezekiel (xliii. 15) the altar that stood upon it is called Har-el,
"the mountain of God." The term reminds us of Babylonia, where the
mercy-seat of the great temple of Bel-Merodach at Babylon was
termed Du-azagga, "the holy hill." It was on this "seat of the
oracles," as it was termed, that the god enthroned himself at the
beginning of each year, and announced his will to <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>{78}</span> mankind. But
the mercy-seat was entitled "the holy hill" only because it was a
miniature copy of "the holy hill" upon which the whole temple was
erected. So, too, at Jerusalem, the altar is called "the mount of
God" by Ezekiel only because it represents that greater "mount of
God" upon which it was built. The temple-hill itself was the
primitive Har-el.</p>
<p>The list of conquered localities in Palestine recorded by
Thothmes III. at Karnak gives indirect testimony to the same fact.
The name of Rabbah of Judah is immediately preceded in it by that
of Har-el, "the mount of God." The position of this Har-el leads us
to the very mountain tract in the midst of which Jerusalem stood.
We now know that Jerusalem was already an important city in the age
of the eighteenth Egyptian dynasty, and that it formed one of the
Egyptian conquests; it would be strange therefore if no notice had
been taken of it by the compiler of the list. May we not see, then,
in the Har-el of the Egyptian scribe the sacred mountain of
Israelitish history?</p>
<p>There is a passage in one of the letters of Ebed-Tob which may
throw further light on the history of the temple-hill.
Unfortunately one of the cuneiform characters in it is badly
formed, so that its reading is not certain, and still more
unfortunately this character is one of the most important in the
whole paragraph. If Dr. Winckler and myself are right in our
copies, Ebed-Tob speaks of "the city of the mountain of Jerusalem,
the city of the temple <span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id=
"page79"></a>{79}</span> of the god Nin-ip, (whose) name (there) is
Salim, the city of the king." What we read "Salim," however, is
read differently by Dr. Zimmern, so that according to his copy the
passage must be translated: "the city of the mountain of Jerusalem,
the city of the temple of the god Nin-ip is its name, the city of
the king." In the one case Ebed-Tob will state explicitly that the
god of Jerusalem, whom he identifies with the Babylonian Nin-ip, is
Salim or Sulman, the god of peace, and that his temple stood on
"the mountain of Jerusalem"; in the other case there will be no
mention of Salim, and it will be left doubtful whether or not the
city of Beth-Nin-ip was included within the walls of the capital.
It would seem rather that it was separate from Jerusalem, though
standing on the same "mountain" as the great fortress. If so, we
might identify Jerusalem with the city on Mount Zion, the Jebusite
stronghold of a later date, while "the city of Beth-Nin-ip" would
be that which centred round the temple on Moriah.</p>
<p>However this may be, the fortress and the temple-hill were
distinct from one another in the days of the Jebusites, and we may
therefore assume that they were also distinct in the age of
Abraham. This might explain why it was that the mountain of Moriah
on the summit of which the patriarch offered his sacrifice was not
enclosed within the walls of Jerusalem, and was not covered with
buildings. It was a spot, on the contrary, where sheep <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>{80}</span> could feed,
and a ram be caught by its horns in the thick brushwood.</p>
<p>In entering Canaan, Abraham would have found himself still
surrounded by all the signs of a familiar civilization. The
long-continued influence and government of Babylonia had carried to
"the land of the Amorites" all the elements of Chald&aelig;an
culture. Migration from Ur of the Chaldees to the distant West
meant a change only in climate and population, not in the
civilization to which the patriarch had been accustomed.</p>
<p>Even the Babylonian language was known and used in the cities of
Canaan, and the literature of Babylonia was studied by the
Canaanitish people. This is one of the facts which we have learnt
from the discovery of the Tel el-Amarna tablets. The cuneiform
system of writing and the Babylonian language had spread all over
Western Asia, and nowhere had they taken deeper root than in
Canaan. Here there were schools and teachers for instruction in the
foreign language and script, and record-chambers and libraries in
which the letters and books of clay could be copied and
preserved.</p>
<p>Long before the discovery of the Tel el-Amarna tablets we might
have gathered from the Old Testament itself that such libraries
once existed in Canaan. One of the Canaanitish cities taken and
destroyed by the Israelites was Debir in the mountainous part of
Judah. But Debir, "the sanctuary," was also known by two other
names. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id=
"page81"></a>{81}</span> It was called Kirjath-Sannah, "the city of
Instruction," as well as Kirjath-Sepher, "the city of Books."</p>
<p>We now know, however, that the latter name is not quite correct.
The Massoretic punctuation has to be emended, and we must read
Kirjath-Sopher, "the city of the Scribe(s)," instead of
Kirjath-Sepher, "the city of Book(s)." It is an Egyptian papyrus
which has given us the exact name. In the time of Ramses II. an
Egyptian scribe composed a sarcastic account of the misadventures
met with by a tourist in Palestine&mdash;commonly known as <i>The
Travels of a Mohar</i>&mdash;and in this mention is made of two
adjoining towns in Southern Palestine called Kirjath-Anab and
Beth-Sopher. In the Book of Joshua the towns of Anab and
Kirjath-Sepher are similarly associated together, and it is plain,
therefore, as Dr. W. Max M&uuml;ller has remarked, that the
Egyptian writer has interchanged the equivalent terms Kirjath,
"city," and Beth, "house." He ought to have written Beth-Anab and
Kirjath-Sopher. But he has given us the true form of the latter
name, and as he has added to the word <i>Sopher</i> the
determinative of "writing," he has further put beyond question the
real meaning of the name. The city must have been one of those
centres of Canaanitish learning, where, as in the libraries of
Babylonia and Assyria, a large body of scribes was kept constantly
at work.</p>
<p>The language employed in the cuneiform documents <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>{82}</span> was almost
always that of Babylonia, which had become the common speech of
diplomacy and educated society. But at times the native language of
the country was also employed, and one or two examples of it have
been preserved. The legends and traditions of Babylonia served as
text-books for the student, and doubtless Babylonian history was
carried to the West as well. The account of Chedor-laomer's
campaign might have been derived in this way from the clay-books of
ancient Babylonia.</p>
<p>Babylonian theology, too, made its way to the West, and has left
records of itself in the map of Canaan. In the names of Canaanitish
towns and villages the names of Babylonian deities frequently
recur. Rimmon or Hadad, the god of the air, whom the Syrians
identified with the Sun-god, Nebo, the god of prophecy, the
interpreter of the will of Bel-Merodach, Anu, the god of the sky,
and Anat, his consort, all alike meet us in the names sometimes of
places, sometimes of persons. Mr. Tomkins is probably right in
seeing even in Beth-lehem the name of the primeval Chald&aelig;an
deity Lakhmu. The Canaanitish Moloch is the Babylonian Malik, and
Dagon was one of the oldest of Chald&aelig;an divinities and the
associate of Anu. We have seen how ready Ebed-Tob was to identify
the god he worshipped with the Babylonian Nin-ip, and among the
Canaanites mentioned in the letters of Tel el-Amarna there is more
than one whose name is compounded with that of a Babylonian
god.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>{83}</span>
<p>Writing and literature, religion and mythology, history and
science, all these were brought to the peoples of Canaan in the
train of Babylonian conquest and trade. Art naturally went hand in
hand with this imported culture. The seal-cylinders of the
Chald&aelig;ans were imitated, and Babylonian figures and
ornamental designs were borrowed and modified by the Canaanitish
artists. It was in this way that the rosette, the cherub, the
sacred tree, and the palmette passed to the West, and there served
to adorn the metal-work and pottery. New designs, unknown in
Babylonia, began to develop; among others, the heads of animals in
gold and silver as covers for metal vases. Some of these "vases of
Kaft," as they were called, are pictured on the Egyptian monuments,
and Thothmes III. in his annals describes "the paterae with goats'
heads upon them and one with a lion's head, the productions of
Zahi," or Palestine, which were brought to him as tribute.</p>
<p>The spoil which the same Pharaoh carried away from the
Canaanitish princes gives us some idea of the art which they
patronized. We hear of chariots and tent-poles covered with plates
of gold, of iron armour and helmets, of gold and silver rings which
were used in the place of money, of staves of ivory, ebony, and
cedar inlaid with gold, of golden sceptres, of tables, chairs, and
footstools of cedar wood, inlaid some of them with ivory, others
with gold and precious stones, of vases and bowls of all kinds in
gold, silver, and bronze, and <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page84" id="page84"></a>{84}</span> of the two-handled cups which
were a special manufacture of Phoenicia. Iron seems to have been
worked in Canaan from an early date. The Israelites were unable to
drive out the inhabitants of "the valley" because of their chariots
of iron, and when the chariot of the Egyptian Mohar is disabled by
the rough roads of the Canaanite mountains the writer of the
papyrus already referred to makes him turn aside at once to a
worker in iron. There was no difficulty in finding an ironsmith in
Canaan.</p>
<p>The purple dye of Phoenicia had been famous from a remote
antiquity. It was one of the chief objects of the trade which was
carried on by the Canaanites with Egypt on the one side and
Babylonia on the other. It was doubtless in exchange for the purple
that the "goodly Babylonish garment" of which we are told in the
Book of Joshua (vii. 21) made its way to the city of Jericho, for
Babylonia was as celebrated for its embroidered robes as Canaan was
for its purple dye.</p>
<p>We hear something about the trade of Canaan in one of the
cuneiform tablets of Tel el-Amarna. This is a letter from
Kallimma-Sin, king of Babylonia, to the Egyptian Pharaoh urging him
to conclude a treaty in accordance with which the merchants of
Babylonia might trade with Egypt on condition of their paying the
customs at the frontier. Gold, silver, oil, and clothing are among
the objects upon which the duty was to be levied. The frontier was
probably fixed at the borders of <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page85" id="page85"></a>{85}</span> the Egyptian province of
Canaan rather than at those of Egypt itself.</p>
<p>Babylonia and the civilized lands of the East were not the only
countries with which Canaanitish trade was carried on. Negro slaves
were imported from the Soudan, copper and lead from Cyprus, and
horses from Asia Minor, while the excavations of Mr. Bliss at
Lachish have brought to light beads of Baltic amber mixed with the
scarabs of the eighteenth Egyptian dynasty.</p>
<p>A large part of the trade of Phoenicia was carried on in ships.
It was in this way that the logs of cedar were brought from the
forests at the head of the Gulf of Antioch, and the purple murex
from the coasts of the <i>&AElig;gean</i>. Tyre, whose wealth is
already celebrated in one of the Tel el-Amarna tablets, was built
upon an island, and, as an Egyptian papyrus tells us, water had to
be conveyed to it in boats. So, too, was Arvad, whose navy occupies
an important place in the Tel el-Amarna correspondence. The ships
of Canaan were, in fact, famous from an early date. Two classes of
vessel known to the Egyptians were called "ships of Gebal" and
"ships of Kaft," or Phoenicia, and Ebed-Tob asserts that "as long
as a ship sails upon the sea, the arm (or oracle) of the Mighty
King shall conquer the forces of Aram-Naharaim (Nahrima) and
Babylonia." Balaam's prophecy&mdash;"Ships shall come from Chittim
and shall afflict Asshur and shall afflict Eber," takes us back to
the same age.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>{86}</span>
<p>The Aram-Naharaim of Scripture is the Nahrina of the
hieroglyphic texts, the Mitanni of the native inscriptions. The
capital city Mitanni stood on the eastern bank of the Euphrates, at
no great distance from Carchemish, but the Naharaim, or "Two
Rivers," more probably mean the Euphrates and Orontes, than the
Euphrates and Tigris. In one of the Tel el-Amarna tablets the
country is called Nahrima, but its usual name is Mitanni or
Mitanna. It was the first independent kingdom of any size or power
on the frontiers of the Egyptian empire in the age of the
eighteenth dynasty, and the Pharaohs Thothmes IV., Amenophis III.,
and Amenophis IV. successively married into its royal family.</p>
<p>The language of Mitanni has been revealed to us by the cuneiform
correspondence from Tel el-Amarna. It was highly agglutinative, and
unlike any other form of speech, ancient or modern, with which we
are acquainted. Perhaps the speakers of it, like the Hittites, had
descended from the north, and occupied territory which had
originally belonged to Aramaic tribes. Perhaps, on the other hand,
they represented the older population of the country which was
overpowered and displaced by Semitic invaders. Which of these views
is the more correct we shall probably never know.</p>
<p>Along with their own language the people of Mitanni had also
their own theology. Tessupas was god of the atmosphere, the Hadad
of the Semites, Sausbe was identified with the Phoenician
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>{87}</span>
Ashteroth, and Sekhrus, Zizanu, and Zannukhu are mentioned among
the other deities. But many of the divinities of Assyria were also
borrowed&mdash;Sin the Moon-god, whose temple stood in the city of
Harran, Ea the god of the waters, Bel, the Baal of the Canaanites,
and Istar, "the lady of Nineveh." Even Amon the god of Thebes was
adopted into the pantheon in the days of Egyptian influence.</p>
<p>How far back the interference of Aram-Naharaim in the affairs of
Canaan may have reached it is impossible to say. But the kingdom
lay on the high-road from Babylonia and Assyria to the West, and
its rise may possibly have had something to do with the decline of
Babylonian supremacy in Palestine. The district in which it grew up
was called Suru or Suri by the Sumerian inhabitants of
Chald&aelig;a&mdash;a name which may be the origin of the modern
"Syria," rather than Assyria, as is usually supposed, and the
Semitic Babylonians gave it the title of Subari or Subartu. The
conquest of Suri was the work of the last campaign of Sargon of
Accad, and laid all northern Mesopotamia at his feet.</p>
<p>We gather from the letters of Tel el-Amarna that the Babylonians
were still intriguing in Canaan in the century before the Exodus,
though they acknowledged that it was an Egyptian province and
subject to Egyptian laws. But the memory of the power they had once
exercised there still survived, and the influence of their culture
continued undiminished. When their rule <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>{88}</span> actually
ceased we do not yet know. It cannot have been very long, however,
before the era of Egyptian conquest. In the Tel el-Amarna tablets
they are always called Kassites, a name which could have been given
to them only after the conquest of Babylonia by the Kassite
mountaineers of Elam, and the rise of a Kassite dynasty of kings.
This was about 1730 B.C. For some time subsequently, therefore, the
government of Babylonia must still have been acknowledged in
Canaan. With this agrees a statement of the Egyptian historian
Manetho, upon which the critics, in their wisdom or their
ignorance, have poured unmeasured contempt. He tells us that when
the Hyksos were driven out of Egypt by Ahmes I., the founder of the
eighteenth dynasty, they occupied Jerusalem and fortified
it&mdash;not, as would naturally be imagined, against the Egyptian
Pharaoh, but against "the Assyrians," as the Babylonians were
called by Manetho's contemporaries. As long as there were no
monuments to confront them the critics had little difficulty in
proving that the statement was preposterous and unhistorical, that
Jerusalem did not as yet exist, and that no Assyrians or
Babylonians entered Palestine until centuries later. But we now
know that Manetho was right and his critics wrong. Jerusalem did
exist, and Babylonian armies threatened the independence of the
Canaanite states. In one of his letters, Ebed-Tob, king of
Jerusalem, tells the Pharaoh that he need not be alarmed about the
Babylonians, for the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id=
"page89"></a>{89}</span> temple at Jerusalem is strong enough to
resist their attack. Rib-Hadad the governor of Gebal bears the same
testimony. "When thou didst sit on the throne of thy father," he
says, "the sons of Ebed-Asherah (the Amorite) attached themselves
to the country of the Babylonians, and took the country of the
Pharaoh for themselves; they (intrigued with) the king of Mitanna,
and the king of the Babylonians, and the king of the Hittites." In
another despatch he speaks in a similar strain: "The king of the
Babylonians and the king of Mitanna are strong, and have taken the
country of the Pharaoh for themselves already, and have seized the
cities of thy governor." When George the Synkellos notes that the
Chald&aelig;ans made war against the Phoenicians in B.C. 1556, he
is doubtless quoting from some old and trustworthy source.</p>
<p>We must not imagine, however, that there was any permanent
occupation of Canaan on the part of the Babylonians at this period
of its history. It would seem rather that Babylonian authority was
directly exercised only from time to time, and had to be enforced
by repeated invasions and campaigns. It was the influence of
Babylonian civilization and culture that was permanent, not the
Babylonian government itself. Sometimes, indeed, Canaan became a
Babylonian province, at other times there were only certain
portions of the country which submitted to the foreign control,
while again at other times the Babylonian rule was merely nominal.
But it is clear that it was not until <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>{90}</span> Canaan had
been thoroughly reduced by Egyptian arms that the old claim of
Babylonia to be its mistress was finally renounced, and even then
we see that intrigues were carried on with the Babylonians against
the Egyptian authority.</p>
<p>It was during this period of Babylonian influence and tutelage
that the traditions and myths of Chald&aelig;a became known to the
people of Canaan. It is again the tablets of Tel el-Amarna which
have shown us how this came to pass. Among them are fragments of
Babylonian legends, one of which endeavoured to account for the
creation of man and the introduction of sin into the world, and
these legends were used as exercise-books in the foreign language
by the scribes of Canaan and Egypt who were learning the Babylonian
language and script. If ever we discover the library of
Kirjath-sepher we shall doubtless find among its clay records
similar examples of Chald&aelig;an literature. The resemblances
between the cosmogonies of Phoenicia and Babylonia have often been
pointed out, and since the discovery of the Chald&aelig;an account
of the Deluge by George Smith we have learned that between that
account and the one which is preserved in Genesis there is the
closest possible likeness, extending even to words and phrases. The
long-continued literary influence of Babylonia in Palestine in the
Patriarchal Age explains all this, and shows us how the traditions
of Chald&aelig;a made their way to the West. When Abraham entered
Canaan, he entered a country <span class="pagenum"><a name="page91"
id="page91"></a>{91}</span> whose educated inhabitants were already
familiar with the books, the history, and the traditions of that in
which he had been born. There were doubtless many to whom the name
and history of "Ur of the Chaldees" were already known. It may even
be that copies of the books in its library already existed in the
libraries of Canaan.</p>
<p>There was one Babylonian hero at all events whose name had
become so well known in the West that it had there passed into a
proverb. This was the name of Nimrod, "the mighty hunter before the
Lord." As yet the cuneiform documents are silent about him, but it
is probable that he was one of the early Kassite kings who
established their dominion over the cities of Babylonia. He is
called the son of Cush or Kas, and "the beginning of his kingdom"
was Babylon, which had now for six centuries been the capital of
the country. His name, however, was as familiar to the Canaanite as
it was to the inhabitant of Chald&aelig;a, and the god before whom
his exploits were displayed was Yahveh and not Bel.</p>
<p>It was about 1600 B.C. that the Hyksos were finally expelled
from Egypt. They were originally Asiatic hordes who had overrun the
valley of the Nile, and held it in subjection for several
centuries. At first they had carried desolation with them wherever
they went. The temples of the Egyptian gods were destroyed and
their priests massacred. But before long Egyptian culture proved
too strong for the invaders. The rude chief of a savage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>{92}</span>
horde became transformed into an Egyptian Pharaoh, whose court
resembled that of the ancient line of monarchs, and who surrounded
himself with learned men. The cities and temples were restored and
beautified, and art began to flourish once more. Except in one
respect it became difficult to distinguish the Hyksos prince from
his predecessors on the throne of Egypt. That one respect was
religion. The supreme object of Hyksos worship continued to be
Sutekh, the Baal of Western Asia, whose cult the foreigners had
brought with them from their old homes. But even Sutekh was
assimilated to Ra, the Sun-god of On, and the Hyksos Pharaohs felt
no scruple in imitating the native kings and combining their own
names with that of Ra. It was only the Egyptians who refused to
admit the assimilation, and insisted on identifying Sutekh with Set
the enemy of Horus.</p>
<p>At the outset all Egypt was compelled to submit to the Hyksos
domination. Hyksos monuments have been found as far south as
Gebel&ecirc;n and El-Kab, and the first Hyksos dynasty established
its seat in Memphis, the old capital of the country. Gradually,
however, the centre of Hyksos power retreated into the delta. Zoan
or Tanis, the modern San, became the residence of the court: here
the Hyksos kings were in close proximity to their kindred in Asia,
and were, moreover, removed from the unmixed Egyptian population
further south. From Zoan, "built"&mdash;or rather
rebuilt&mdash;"seven <span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id=
"page93"></a>{93}</span> years" after Hebron (Num. xiii. 22), they
governed the valley of the Nile. Their rule was assisted by the
mutual jealousies and quarrels of the native feudal princes who
shared between them the land of Egypt. The foreigner kept his hold
upon the country by means of the old feudal aristocracy.</p>
<p>Thebes, however, had never forgotten that it had been the
birthplace and capital of the powerful Pharaohs of the twelfth and
thirteenth dynasties, of the mighty princes who had conquered the
Soudan, and ruled with an iron hand over the feudal lords. The
heirs of the Theban Pharaohs still survived as princes of Thebes,
and behind the strong walls of El-Kab they began to think of
independence. Apophis II. in his court at Zoan perceived the rising
storm, and endeavoured to check it at its beginning. According to
the story of a later day, he sent insulting messages to the prince
of Thebes, and ordered him to worship Sutekh the Hyksos god. The
prince defied his suzerain, and the war of independence began. It
lasted for several generations, during which the Theban princes
made themselves masters of Upper Egypt, and established a native
dynasty of Pharaohs which reigned simultaneously with the Hyksos
dynasty in the North.</p>
<p>Step by step the Hyksos stranger was pushed back to the
north-eastern corner of the delta. At length Zoan itself fell into
the hands of the Egyptians, and the Hyksos took refuge in the great
fortress of Avaris on the extreme border of the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>{94}</span> kingdom.
Here they were besieged by the Theban prince Ahmes, and eventually
driven back to the Asia from which they had come. The eighteenth
dynasty was founded, and Ahmes entered on that career of Asiatic
conquest which converted Canaan into an Egyptian province. At first
the war was one of revenge; but it soon became one of conquest, and
the war of independence was followed by the rise of the Egyptian
empire. Thothmes II., the grandson of Ahmes, led his forces as far
as the Euphrates and the land of Aram-Naharaim. The territories
thus overrun in a sort of military reconnaissance were conquered
and annexed by his son Thothmes III., during his long reign of
fifty-four years (March 20, B.C. 1503 to February 14, B.C. 1449).
Canaan on both sides of the Jordan was made into a province, and
governed much as India is to-day. Some of the cities were allowed
still to retain their old line of princes, who were called upon to
furnish tribute to the Egyptian treasury and recruits to the
Egyptian army. From time to time they were visited by an Egyptian
"Commissioner," and an Egyptian garrison kept watch upon their
conduct. Sometimes an Egyptian Resident was appointed by the side
of the native king; this was the case, for example, at Sidon and
Hazor. Where, however, the city was of strategical or political
importance it was incorporated into the Egyptian empire, and placed
under the immediate control of an Egyptian governor, as at Megiddo,
Gaza, Gebal, Gezer, and Tyre. Similarly <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>{95}</span> Ziri-Basana,
"the field of Bashan," was under the government of a single
<i>khazan</i> or "prefect." The troops, who also acted as police,
were divided into various classes. There were the <i>tsabi
yidati</i> or "auxiliaries," the <i>tsabi saruti</i> or "militia,"
the <i>Khabbati</i> or "Beduin plunderers," and the <i>tsabi
matsarti</i> or "Egyptian soldiers of the garrison," as well as the
<i>tsabi bitati</i> or "house-guards," who were summoned in cases
of emergency. Among the auxiliaries were included the Serdani or
Sardinians, while the Sute&mdash;the Sati or Sitti of the
hieroglyphic texts&mdash;formed the larger portion of the Beduin
("Bashi-bazouks"), and the Egyptian forces were divided into the
cavalry or rather charioteers, and the Misi (called Mas'u in the
hieroglyphics) or infantry.</p>
<p>Fragments of the annals of Thothmes III. have been preserved on
the shattered walls of his temple at Karnak. Here too we may read
the lists of places he conquered in Palestine&mdash;the land of the
Upper Lotan as it is termed&mdash;as well as in Northern Syria.
Like the annals, the geographical lists have been compiled from
memoranda made on the spot by the scribes who followed the army,
and in some instances, at all events, it can be shown that they
have been translated into Egyptian hieroglyphs from Babylonian
cuneiform. The fact is an indication of the conquest that Asia was
already beginning to make over her Egyptian conquerors. But the
annals themselves are a further and still more convincing proof of
Asiatic influence. To cover the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page96" id="page96"></a>{96}</span> walls of a temple with the
history of campaigns in a foreign land, and an account of the
tribute brought to the Pharaoh, was wholly contrary to Egyptian
ideas. From the Egyptian point of view the decoration of the sacred
edifice should have been theological only. The only subjects
represented on it, so custom and belief had ruled, ought to be the
gods, and the stereotyped phrases describing their attributes,
their deeds, and their festivals. To substitute for this the
records of secular history was Assyrian and not Egyptian. Indeed
the very conception of annalistic chronicling, in which the history
of a reign was given briefly year by year and campaign by campaign,
belonged to the kingdoms of the Tigris and Euphrates, not to that
of the Nile. It was a new thing in Egypt, and flourished there only
during the short period of Asiatic influence. The Egyptian cared
comparatively little for history, and made use of papyrus when he
wished to record it. Unfortunately for us the annals of Thothmes
III. remain the solitary monument of Egyptian chronicling on
stone.</p>
<p>The twenty-second year of his reign (B.C. 1481) was that in
which the Egyptian Pharaoh made his first determined effort to
subdue Canaan. Gaza was occupied without much difficulty, and in
the following year, on the fifth day of the month Pakhons, he set
out from it, and eleven days later encamped at Ihem. There he
learned that the confederated Canaanitish army, under the command
of the king of Kadesh on the Orontes, was awaiting <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>{97}</span> his attack
at Megiddo. Not only were the various nations of Palestine
represented in it, but contingents had come from Naharaim on the
banks of the Euphrates, as well as from the Gulf of Antioch. For a
while Thothmes hesitated whether to march against them by the road
which led through 'Aluna to Taanach or by way of Zaft (perhaps
Safed), whence he would have descended southward upon Megiddo. The
arrival of his spies, however, determined him to take the first,
and accordingly, after the officers had sworn that they would not
leave their appointed posts in battle even to defend the person of
the king, he started on his march, and on the nineteenth of the
month pitched his tent at 'Aluna. The way had been rough and
impassable for chariots, so that the king had been forced to march
on foot.</p>
<p>'Aluna must have been close to Megiddo, since the rear of the
Egyptian forces was stationed there during the battle that
followed, while the southern wing extended to Taanach and the
northern wing to Megiddo. The advanced guard pushed into the plain
below, and the royal tent was set up on the bank of the brook of
Qana, an affluent of the Kishon. The decisive struggle took place
on the twenty-first of the month. Thothmes rode in a chariot of
polished bronze, and posted himself among the troops on the
north-west side of Megiddo. The Canaanites were unable to resist
the Egyptian charge. They fled into the city, leaving behind them
their horses and their chariots <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page98" id="page98"></a>{98}</span> plated with gold and silver,
those who arrived after the gates of the town had been shut being
drawn up over the walls by means of ropes. Had the Egyptians not
stayed behind in order to plunder the enemy's camp they would have
entered Megiddo along with the fugitives. As it was, they were
compelled to blockade the city, building a rampart round it of
"fresh green trees," and the besieged were finally starved into a
surrender.</p>
<p>In the captured camp had been found the son of the king of
Megiddo, besides a large amount of booty, including chariots of
silver and gold from Asi or Cyprus. Two suits of iron armour were
also obtained, one belonging to the king of Kadesh, the other to
the king of Megiddo. The seven tent-poles of the royal tent, plated
with gold, also fell into the hands of the Egyptians. The catalogue
of the spoil was written down on a leather roll which was deposited
in the temple of Amon at Thebes, and in it were enumerated: 3401
prisoners and 83 hands belonging to the slain, 32 chariots plated
with gold, 892 ordinary chariots, 2041 mares, 191 foals, 602 bows,
and 200 suits of armour.</p>
<p>Before the campaign was ended the Egyptian army had penetrated
far to the north and captured Inuam, south of Damascus, as well as
Anugas or Nukhasse, and Harankal, to the north of the land of the
Amorites. All these places seem to have belonged to the king of
Kadesh, as his property was carried away out of them. When Thothmes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>{99}</span>
returned to Thebes the quantity of spoil be brought back with him
was immense. "Besides precious stones," golden bowls, Phoenician
cups with double handles and the like, there were 97 swords, 1784
pounds of gold rings and 966 pounds of silver rings, which served
as money, a statue with a head of gold, tables, chairs, and staves
of cedar and ebony inlaid with gold, ivory and precious stones, a
golden plough, the golden sceptre of the conquered prince, and
richly embroidered stuffs. The fields of the vanquished province
were further measured by the Egyptian surveyors, and the amount of
taxation annually due from them was fixed. More than 208,000
measures of wheat were moreover carried off to Egypt from the plain
of Megiddo. The Canaanitish power was completely broken, and
Thothmes was now free to extend his empire further to the
north.</p>
<p>Accordingly in the following year (B.C. 1479) we find him
receiving tribute from the Assyrian king. This consisted of leather
bracelets, various kinds of wood, and chariots. It was probably at
this time that Carchemish on the Euphrates was taken, the city
being stormed from the riverside. Five years later the first part
of the annals was engraved on the wall of the new temple of Amon at
Karnak, and it concluded with an account of the campaign of the
year. This had been undertaken in Northern Syria, and had resulted
in the capture of Uarrt and Tunip, now Tennib, to the north-west of
Aleppo. No less than one hundred pounds of silver and as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id=
"page100"></a>{100}</span> many of gold were taken from Tunip, as
well as lapis-lazuli from Babylonia, and malachite from the
Sinaitic peninsula, together with vessels of iron and bronze. Some
ships also were captured, laden with slaves, bronze, lead, white
gold, and other products of the Greek seas. On the march home the
Egyptian army took possession of Arvad, and seized its rich stores
of wheat and wine. "Then the soldiers caroused and anointed
themselves with oil as they used to do on feast days in the land of
Egypt."</p>
<p>The next year Kadesh on the Orontes, near the Lake of Horns, was
attacked and destroyed, its trees were cut down and its corn
carried away. From Kadesh Thothmes proceeded to the land of
Phoenicia, and took the cities of Zemar (now Sumra) and Arvad. The
heirs of four of the conquered princes were carried as hostages to
Egypt, "so that when one of these kings should die, then the
Pharaoh should take his son and put him in his stead."</p>
<p>In B.C. 1472 the land of the Amorites was reduced, or rather
that part of it which was known as Takhis, the Thahash of Genesis
xxii. 24, on the shores of the Lake of Merna, in which we should
probably see the Lake of Homs. Nearly 500 prisoners were led to
Egypt. The Syrian princes now came to offer their gifts to the
conqueror, bringing with them, among other things, more than 760
pounds of silver, 19 chariots covered with silver ornaments, and 41
leathern collars covered with bronze scales. At the same time the
whole <span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id=
"page101"></a>{101}</span> country was thoroughly organized under
the new Egyptian administration. Military roads were constructed
and provided with posting-houses, at each of which relays of horses
were kept in readiness, as well as "the necessary provision of
bread of various sorts, oil, balsam, wine, honey, and fruits." The
quarries of the Lebanon were further required to furnish the
Pharaoh with limestone for his buildings in Egypt and
elsewhere.</p>
<p>Two years later Thothmes was again in Syria. He made his way as
far as the Euphrates, and there on the eastern bank erected a stele
by the side of one which his father Thothmes II. had already set
up. The stele was an imperial boundary-stone marking the frontier
of the Egyptian empire. It was just such another stele that
Hadad-ezer of Zobah was intending to restore in the same place when
he was met and defeated by David (2 Sam. viii. 3).</p>
<p>The Pharaoh now took ship and descended the Euphrates,
"conquering the towns and ploughing up the fields of the king of
Naharaim." He then re-ascended the stream to the city of Ni, where
he placed another stele, in proof that the boundary of Egypt had
been extended thus far. Elephants still existed in the
neighbourhood, as they continued to do four and a half centuries
later in the time of the Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser I. Thothmes
amused himself by hunting them, and no less than 120 were
slain.</p>
<p>On his way home the tribute and "yearly tax" <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>{102}</span> of the
inhabitants of the Lebanon was brought to him, and the
corv&eacute;e-work annually required from them was also fixed.
Thothmes indulged his taste for natural history by receiving as
part of the tribute various birds which were peculiar to Syria, or
at all events were unknown in Egypt, and which, we are told, "were
dearer to the king than anything else." He had already established
zoological and botanical gardens in Thebes, and the strange animals
and plants which his campaigns furnished for them were depicted on
the walls of one of the chambers in the temple he built at
Karnak.</p>
<p>Before his return to Egypt he received the tribute of "the king
of Sangar," or Shinar, in Mesopotamia, and "of the land of Khata
the greater." The first consisted for the most part of
lapis-lazuli, real and artificial, of which the most prized was
"the lapis-lazuli of Babylon." Among the gifts was "a ram's head of
real lapis-lazuli, 15 pounds in weight." The land of the Hittites,
"the greater," so called to distinguish it from the lesser Hittite
land in the south of Palestine, sent 8 rings of silver, 400 pounds
in weight, besides "a great piece of crystal."</p>
<p>The following year Thothmes marched through "the land of Zahi,"
the "dry land" of the Phoenician coast, to Northern Syria, where he
punished the king of Anugas or Nukhasse, who had shown symptoms of
rebellion. Large quantities of gold and bronze were carried off, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id=
"page103"></a>{103}</span> well as 15 chariots, plated with gold
and silver, 6 iron tent-poles studded with precious stones, and 70
asses. Lead and various kinds of wood and stone, together with 608
jars of Lebanon wine, 2080 jars of oil, and 690 jars of balsam,
were also received from Southern Syria, and posting-houses were
established along the roads of the land of Zahi. A fleet of
Phoenician merchant vessels was next sent to Egypt laden with logs
of wood from the forests of Palestine and the Lebanon for the
buildings of the king. At the same time, "the king of Cyprus,"
which now was an Egyptian possession, forwarded his tribute to the
Pharaoh, consisting of 108 bricks of copper 2040 pounds in weight,
5 bricks of lead nearly 29,000 pounds in weight, 110 pounds of
lapis-lazuli, an elephant's tusk, and other objects of value.</p>
<p>The next year (B.C. 1468) there was a campaign against the king
of Naharaim, who had collected his soldiers and horses "from the
extreme ends of the world." But the Mesopotamian army was utterly
defeated. Its booty fell into the hands of the Egyptians, who,
however, took only ten prisoners, which looks as if, after all, the
battle was not on a very large scale.</p>
<p>In B.C. 1464 Thothmes was again in Northern Syria. Among the
booty acquired during the expedition were "bowls with goats' heads
on them, and one with a lion's head, the work of the land of Zahi."
Horses, asses and oxen, 522 slaves, 156 jars of wine, 1752 jars of
butter, 5 elephants' tusks, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page104"
id="page104"></a>{104}</span> 2822 pounds of gold besides copper
and lead, were among the spoils of the campaign. The annual tribute
was only received from Cyprus, consisting this time of copper and
mares, as well as from Aripakh, a district in the Taurus.</p>
<p>The next year the Pharaoh led his troops against some country,
the name of which is lost, in "the land of the hostile Shasu" or
Beduin. The plunder which was carried off from it shows that it was
somewhere in Syria, probably in the region of the Lebanon. Gold and
silver, a silver double-handled cup with a bull's head, iron, wine,
balsam, oil, butter and honey, were among the spoils of the war.
Tribute arrived also from "the king of the greater Hittite land,"
which included a number of negro slaves.</p>
<p>Revolt, however, now broke out in the north. Tunip rebelled, as
did also the king of Kadesh, who built a "new" fortress to protect
his city from attack. Thothmes at once marched against them by the
road along "the coast," which led him through the country of the
Fenkhu or Phoenicians. First he fell upon the towns of Alkana and
utterly destroyed them, and then poured his troops into the
neighbouring land of Tunip. The city of Tunip was taken and burnt,
its crops were trodden under-foot, its trees cut down, and its
inhabitants carried into slavery. Then came the turn of Kadesh. The
"new" fortress fell at the first assault, and the whole country was
compelled to submit.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id=
"page105"></a>{105}</span>
<p>The king of Assyria again sent presents to the Pharaoh which the
Egyptian court regarded in the light of tribute. They consisted
chiefly of large blocks of "real lapis-lazuli" as well as
"lapis-lazuli of Babylon." More valuable gifts came from the
subject princes of Syria. Foremost among these was "a king's
daughter all glorious with [a vesture of] gold." Then there were
four chariots plated with gold and six chariots of gold, iron
armour inlaid with gold, a jug of silver, a golden helmet inlaid
with lapis-lazuli, wine, honey and balsam, ivory and various kinds
of wood, wheat in such quantities that it could not be measured,
and the sixty-five slaves who had to be furnished each year as part
of the annual tax.</p>
<p>The annals of the next two years are in too mutilated a
condition to yield much information. Moreover, the campaigns
carried on in them were mainly in the Soudan. In B.C. 1461 the
record closes. It was in that year that the account of the
Pharaoh's victories "which he had gained from the 23rd until the
(4)2nd year" were engraved upon the wall of the temple. (The
inscription has "32nd year," but as the wars extended beyond the
40th year of the king's reign this must be a sculptor's error.) And
the chronicle concludes with the brief but expressive words, "Thus
hath he done: may he live for ever!"</p>
<p>Thothmes, indeed, did not live for ever, but he survived the
completion of his temple fourteen years. His death was followed by
the revolt of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id=
"page106"></a>{106}</span> Northern Syria, and the first
achievement of his son and successor, Amen&ocirc;phis II., was its
suppression. Ni and Ugarit, the centres of disaffection, were
captured and punished, and among the prisoners from Ugarit were 640
"Canaanite" merchants with their slaves. The name of Canaanite had
thus already acquired that secondary meaning of "merchant" which we
find in the Old Testament (Is. xxiii. 8; Ezek. xvii. 4). It is a
significant proof of the commercial activity and trading
establishments of the Canaanite race throughout the civilized
world. Even a cuneiform tablet from Kappadokia, which is probably
of the same age as the tablets of Tel el-Amarna, gives us the name
of Kinanim "the Canaanite" as that of a witness to a deed. It was
not always, however, that the Canaanites were so honourably
distinguished. At times the name was equivalent to that of "slave"
rather than of "merchant," as in a papyrus [Anast. 4, 16, 2.] where
mention is made of Kan'amu or "Canaanite slaves from Khal." So too
in another papyrus we hear of a slave called Saruraz the son of
Naqati, whose mother was Kadi from the land of Arvad. The Egyptian
wars in Palestine must necessarily have resulted in the enslavement
of many of its inhabitants, and, as we have seen, a certain number
of young slaves formed part of the annual tax levied upon
Syria.</p>
<p>The successors of Thothmes III. extended the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>{107}</span> Egyptian
empire far to the south in the Soudan. But its Asiatic limits had
already been reached. Palestine, along with Phoenicia, the land of
the Amorites and the country east of the Jordan, was constituted
into an Egyptian province and kept strictly under Egyptian control.
Further north the connection with the imperial government was
looser. There were Egyptian fortresses and garrisons here and
there, and certain important towns like Tunip near Aleppo and Qatna
on the Khab&ucirc;r were placed under Egyptian prefects. But
elsewhere the conquered populations were allowed to remain under
their native kings. In some instances, as, for example, in Anugas
or Nukhasse, the kings were little more than satraps of the
Pharaoh, but in other instances, like Alasiya, north of Hamath,
they resembled the rulers of the protected states in modern India.
In fact, the king of Alasiya calls the Pharaoh his "brother," and
except for the obligation of paying tribute was practically an
independent sovereign.</p>
<p>The Egyptian dominion was acknowledged as far north as Mount
Amanus. Carchemish, soon to become a Hittite stronghold, was in
Egyptian hands, and the Hittites themselves had not yet emerged
from the fortresses of the Taurus. Their territory was still
confined to Kataonia and Armenia Minor between Melit&ecirc;n&ecirc;
and the Saros, and they courted the favour of the Egyptian monarch
by sending him gifts. Thothmes would have refused to believe that
before many years were over they <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page108" id="page108"></a>{108}</span> would wrest Northern Syria
from his successors, and contend on equal terms with the Egyptian
Pharaoh.</p>
<p>The Egyptian possessions on the east bank of Euphrates lay along
the course of the Khab&ucirc;r, towards the oasis of Singar or
Shinar. North of the Belikh came the powerful kingdom of Mitanni,
Aram-Naharaim as it is called in the Old Testament, which was never
subdued by the Egyptian arms, and whose royal family intermarried
with the successors of Thothmes. Mitanni, the capital, stood nearly
opposite Carchemish, which thus protected the Egyptian frontier on
the east.</p>
<p>Southward of the Belikh the frontier was formed by the desert.
Syria, Bashan, Ammon, and Moab were all included in the Pharaoh's
empire. But there it came to an end. Mount Seir was never conquered
by the Egyptians. The "city" of Edom appears in one of the Tel
el-Amarna tablets as a foreign state whose inhabitants wage war
against the Egyptian territory. The conquest of the Edomites in
their mountain fastnesses would have been a matter of difficulty,
nor would anything have been gained by it. Edom was rich neither
agriculturally nor commercially; it was, in fact, a land of barren
mountains, and the trade which afterwards passed through the Arabah
to Elath and Ezion-geber in the Gulf of Aqabah was already secured
to the Egyptians through their possession of the Gulf of Suez. The
first and last of the Pharaohs, so far as we know, who ventured on
a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id=
"page109"></a>{109}</span> campaign against the wild tribes of
Mount Seir, was Ramses III. of the twentieth dynasty, and his
campaign was merely a punitive one. No attempt to incorporate the
"Red Land" into his dominions was ever made by an Egyptian
king.</p>
<p>The Sinaitic peninsula, the province of Mafkat or "Malachite,"
as it was called, had been in the possession of the Egyptians since
the time of Zosir of the third dynasty, and it continued to be
regarded as part of the Egyptian kingdom up to the age of the
Ptolemies. The earliest of Egyptian rock-sculptures is engraved in
the peninsula, and represents Snefru, the founder of the fourth
dynasty, slaughtering the Beduin who inhabited it. Its possession
was valued on account of its mines of copper and malachite. These
were worked by the Egyptian kings with the help of convict labour.
Garrisons were established to protect them and the roads which led
to them, colonies of officials grew up at their side, and temples
were built dedicated to the deities of Egypt. Even as late as the
reign of Ramses III. the amount of minerals produced by the mines
was enormous. They existed for the most part on the western side of
the peninsula, opposite the Egyptian coast; but Ramses III. also
opened copper mines in the land of 'Ataka further east, and the
name of the goddess Hathor in hieroglyphics has been found by Dr.
Friedmann on the shores of Midian.</p>
<p>Vanquished Syria was made to contribute to the endowments of the
Egyptian temples. Thus the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page110"
id="page110"></a>{110}</span> temple of Amon at Thebes was endowed
by Thothmes III. with the revenues of the three cities Anugas,
Inu'am, and Harankal; while Seti I., the father of Ramses II.,
bestowed upon it "all the silver, gold, lapis-lazuli, malachite,
and precious stones which he carried off from the humbled land of
Syria." Temples of the Egyptian gods, as well as towns, were built
in Syria itself; Meneptah founded a city in the land of the
Amorites; Ramses III. erected a temple to Amon in "the land of
Canaan, great as the horizon of heaven above, to which the people
of Syria come with their gifts"; and hieroglyphic inscriptions
lately discovered at Gaza show that another temple had been built
there by Amenophis II. to the goddess Mut.</p>
<p>Amenophis had suppressed the rebellion in Northern Syria with
little trouble. Seven Amorite kings were carried prisoners to Egypt
from the land of Takhis, and taken up the river as far as Thebes.
There six of them were hung outside the walls of the city, as the
body of Saul was hung by the Philistines outside the walls of
Beth-shan, while the seventh was conveyed to Napata in Ethiopia,
and there punished in the same way in order to impress a lesson of
obedience upon the negroes of the Soudan.</p>
<p>Amenophis II. was succeeded by Thothmes IV., who was called upon
to face a new enemy, the Hittites. It was at the commencement of
his reign that they first began to descend from their mountain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id=
"page111"></a>{111}</span> homes, and the frontier city of Tunip
had to bear the brunt of the attack. It was probably in order to
strengthen himself against these formidable foes that the Pharaoh
married the daughter of the king of Mitanni, who changed her name
to Mut-em-ua. It was the beginning of those inter-marriages with
the princes of Asia which led to the Asiatized court and religion
of Amenophis IV., and finally to the overthrow of the eighteenth
dynasty.</p>
<p>The son of Mut-em-ua was Amenophis III., whose long reign of
thirty-seven years was as brilliant and successful as that of
Thothmes III. At Soleb between the second and third cataracts he
built a temple to his own deified self, and engraved upon its
columns the names of his vassal states. Among them are Tunip and
Kadesh, Carchemish and Apphadana on the Khab&ucirc;r. Sangar,
Assyria, Naharaim, and the Hittites also appear among them, but
this must be on the strength of the tribute or presents which had
been received from them. The Pharaoh filled his har&icirc;m with
Asiatic princesses. His queen Teie, who exercised an important
influence upon both religion and politics, came from Asia, and
among his wives were the sisters and daughters of the kings of
Babylonia and Mitanni, while one of his own daughters was married
to Burna-buryas the Babylonian sovereign. His marriage with
Gilu-khipa, the daughter of Sutarna, king of Aram-Naharaim, was
celebrated on a scarab, where it is further <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>{112}</span> related
that she was accompanied to Egypt by three hundred and seventeen
"maids of honour." Besides allying himself in marriage to the royal
houses of Asia, Amenophis III. passed a good deal of his time in
Syria and Mesopotamia, amusing himself with hunting lions. During
the first ten years of his reign he boasts of having killed no less
than one hundred and two of them. It was in the last of these years
that he married queen Teie, who is said on scarabs to have been the
daughter of "Yua and Tua." Possibly these are contracted forms of
Tusratta and Yuni, who were at the time king and queen of Mitanni.
But if so, it is curious that no royal titles are given to her
parents; moreover, the author of the scarabs has made Yua the
father of the queen and Tua her mother. Tuya is the name of an
Amorite in one of the Tel el-Amarna letters, while from another of
them it would seem as if Teie had been the daughter of the
Babylonian king. One of the daughters of Tusratta, Tadu-khipa, was
indeed married to Amenophis, but she did not rank as chief queen.
In the reign of Meneptah of the nineteenth dynasty the vizier was a
native of Bashan, Ben-Mazana by name, whose father was called Yu
the elder. Yua may therefore be a word of Amorite origin; and a
connection has been suggested between it and the Hebrew Yahveh.
This, however, though possible, cannot be proved.</p>
<p>When Amenophis III. died his son Amenophis IV. seems to have
been still a minor. At all events <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page113" id="page113"></a>{113}</span> the queen-mother Teie
became all-powerful in the government of the state. Her son, the
new Pharaoh, had been brought up in the religious beliefs of his
mother, and had inherited the ideas and tendencies of his Asiatic
forefathers. A plaster-cast of his face, taken immediately after
death, was discovered by Prof. Petrie at Tel el-Amarna, and it is
the face of a refined and thoughtful theorist, of a philosopher
rather than of a king, earnest in his convictions almost to
fanaticism.</p>
<p>Amenophis IV. undertook no less a task than that of reforming
the State religion of Egypt. For many centuries the religion of the
priests and scribes had been inclining to pantheism. Inside the
temples there had been an esoteric teaching, that the various
deities of Egypt were but manifestations of the one supreme God.
But it had hardly passed outside them. With the accession of
Amenophis IV. to the throne came a change. The young king boldly
rejected the religion of which he was officially the head, and
professed himself a worshipper of the one God whose visible
semblance was the solar disk. Alone of the deities of Egypt Ra, the
ancient Sun-god of Heliopolis, was acknowledged to be the
representative of the true God. It was the Baal-worship of Syria,
modified by the philosophic conceptions of Egypt. The Aten-Ra of
the "heretic" Pharaoh was an Asiatic Baal, but unlike the Baal of
Canaan he stood alone; there were no other Baals, no Baalim, by the
side of him.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id=
"page114"></a>{114}</span>
<p>Amenophis was not content with preaching and encouraging the new
faith; he sought to force it upon his subjects. The other gods of
Egypt were proscribed, and the name and head of Amon, the patron
god of Thebes, to whom his ancestors had ascribed their power and
victories, were erased from the monuments wherever they occurred.
Even his own father's name was not spared, and the emissaries of
the king, from one end of the country to the other, defaced that
portion of it which contained the name of the god. His own name was
next changed, and Amenophis IV. became Khu-n-Aten, "the splendour
of the solar disk."</p>
<p>Khu-n-Aten's attempt to overthrow the ancient faith of Egypt was
naturally resisted by the powerful priesthood of Thebes. A
religious war was declared for the first time, so far as we know,
in the history of mankind. On the one side a fierce persecution was
directed against the adherents of the old creed; on the other side
every effort was made to impede and defeat the Pharaoh. His
position grew daily more insecure, and at last he turned his back
on the capital of his fathers, and built himself a new city far
away to the north. The priests of Amon had thus far triumphed; the
old idolatrous worship was carried on once more in the great temple
of Karnak, though its official head was absent, and Khu-n-Aten with
his archives and his court had fled to a safer home. Upper Egypt
was left to its worship of Amon and Min, while the king established
himself nearer his Canaanite possessions.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id=
"page115"></a>{115}</span>
<p>Here on the eastern bank of the Nile, about midway between
Minyeh and Si&ucirc;t, the new capital was founded on a strip of
land protected from attack by a semi-amphitheatre of cliffs. The
city, with its palaces and gardens, extended nearly two miles in
length along the river bank. In its midst rose the temple of the
new god of Egypt, and hard by the palace of the king. Both were
brilliant with painting and sculpture, and inlaid work in precious
stones and gold. Even the floors were frescoed, while the walls and
columns were enamelled or adorned with the most costly materials
that the Egyptian world could produce. Here and there were statues
of alabaster, of bronze or of gold, some of them almost Greek in
form and design. Along with the reform in religion there had gone a
reform in art. The old conventionalized art of Egypt was abandoned,
and a new art had been introduced which aimed at imitating nature
with realistic fidelity.</p>
<p>The mounds which mark the site of Khu-n-Aten's city are now
known as Tel el-Amarna. It had a brief but brilliant existence of
about thirty years. Then the enemies of the Pharaoh and his work of
reform finally prevailed, and his city with its temple and palaces
was levelled to the ground. It is from among its ruins that the
wondering fellah and explorer of to-day exhume the gorgeous relics
of its past.</p>
<p>But among these relics none have proved more precious than the
clay tablets inscribed with <span class="pagenum"><a name="page116"
id="page116"></a>{116}</span> cuneiform characters, which have
revolutionized our conceptions of the ancient East. They were
preserved in the Foreign Office of the day. This formed part of the
public buildings connected with the palace, and the bricks of which
it was built were stamped with an inscription describing its
character. Many of the tablets had been brought from the archive
chamber of Thebes, but the greater part of the collection belongs
to the reign of Khu-n-Aten himself. It consists almost entirely of
official correspondence; of letters from the kings of Babylonia and
Assyria, of Mesopotamia and Kappadokia, and of despatches from the
Egyptian governors and vassal-princes in Syria and Palestine. They
furnish us with a living and unexpected picture of Canaan about
1400 B.C.</p>
<p>Fragments of dictionaries for the use of the scribes have also
been recovered from the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of the building, as
well as the seal of a servant of Samas-akh-iddin who looked after
the cuneiform correspondence. Like several of the Canaanitish
governors, he bore a Babylonian name. Even the brother of Amenophis
III., who had been made king of Nukhasse, had received the
Babylonian name of Rimmon-nirari. No stronger proof could be found
of the extent and strength of Babylonian influence in the West.</p>
<p>At Khut-Aten, as the "heretic" Pharaoh called his new capital,
he was surrounded by the adherents of the new faith. Many of them
were doubtless Egyptians, but many, perhaps the majority, were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id=
"page117"></a>{117}</span> of Asiatic extraction. Already under his
father and grandfather the court had been filled with Canaanites
and other natives of Asia, and the great offices of state had been
occupied by them. Now under Khu-n-Aten the Asiatic character of the
government was increased tenfold. The native Egyptian had to make
way for the foreigner, and the rule of the Syrian stranger which
seemed to have been expelled with the Hyksos was restored under
another form. Canaan was nominally a subject province of Egypt, but
in reality it had led its conqueror captive. A semi-Asiatic Pharaoh
was endeavouring to force an Asiatic form of faith upon his
subjects, and entrusting his government to Asiatic officials; even
art had ceased to be Egyptian and had put on an Asiatic dress.</p>
<p>The tombs of Khu-n-Aten's followers are cut in the cliffs at the
back of the city, while his own sepulchre is towards the end of a
long ravine which runs out into the eastern desert between two
lofty lines of precipitous rock. But few of them are finished, and
the sepulchre of the king himself, magnificent in its design, is
incomplete and mutilated. The sculptures on the walls have been
broken, and the granite sarcophagus in which the body of the great
king rested has been shattered into fragments before it could be
lifted into the niche where it was intended to stand. The royal
mummy was torn into shreds, and the porcelain figures buried with
it dashed to the ground.</p>
<p>It is clear that the death of Khu-n-Aten must <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>{118}</span> have been
quickly followed by the triumph of his enemies. His capital was
overthrown, the stones of its temple carried away to Thebes, there
to adorn the sanctuary of the victorious Amon, and the adherents of
his reform either slain or driven into exile. The vengeance
executed upon them was national as well as religious. It meant not
only a restoration of the national faith, but also the restoration
of the native Egyptian to the government of his country. The
feelings which inspired it were similar to those which underlay the
movement of Arabi in our own time, and there was no English army to
stand in the way of its success. The rise of the nineteenth dynasty
represents the triumph of the national cause.</p>
<p>The cuneiform letters of Tel el-Amarna show that already before
Khu-n-Aten's death his empire and power were breaking up. Letter
after letter is sent to him from the governors in Canaan with
urgent requests for troops. The Hittites were attacking the empire
in the north, and rebels were overthrowing it within. "If
auxiliaries come this year," writes Ebed-Tob of Jerusalem, "the
provinces of the king my lord will be preserved; but if no
auxiliaries come the provinces of the king my lord will be
destroyed." To these entreaties no answer could be returned. There
was civil and religious war in Egypt itself, and the army was
needed to defend the Pharaoh at home.</p>
<p>The picture of Canaan presented to us by the Tel el-Amarna
correspondence has been supplemented <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page119" id="page119"></a>{119}</span> by the discovery of
Lachish. Five years ago Prof. Flinders Petrie undertook to excavate
for the Palestine Exploration Fund in the lofty mound of Tel
el-Hesi in Southern Palestine. Tel el-Hesi stands midway between
Gaza and Hebron on the edge of the Judaean mountains, and
overlooking a torrent stream. His excavations resulted in the
discovery of successive cities built one upon the ruins of the
other, and in the probability that the site was that of Lachish.
The excavations were resumed by Mr. Bliss in the following year,
and the probability was raised to practical certainty. The lowest
of the cities was the Lachish of the Amorite period, whose crude
brick walls, nearly twenty-nine feet in thickness, have been
brought to light, while its pottery has revealed to us for the
first time the characteristics of Amorite manufacture. The huge
walls bear out the testimony of the Israelitish spies, that the
cities of the Amorites were "great and walled up to heaven" (Deut.
i. 28). They give indications, however, that in spite of their
strength the fortresses they enclosed must have been captured more
than once. Doubtless this was during the age of the Egyptian wars
in Canaan.</p>
<p>As at Troy, it is probable that it was only the citadel which
was thus strongly fortified. Below it was the main part of the
town, the inhabitants of which took refuge in the citadel when an
enemy threatened to attack them. The fortified part, indeed, was
not of very large extent. Its ruins measured only about two hundred
feet each way, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id=
"page120"></a>{120}</span> while the enclosure within which it
stands is a quarter of a mile in diameter. Here a regular series of
pottery has been found, dating from the post-exilic age through
successive strata back to the primitive Amoritish fortress. To
Prof. Petrie belongs the credit of determining the characteristics
of these various strata, and fixing their approximate age.</p>
<p>The work begun by Prof. Petrie was continued by Mr. Bliss. Deep
down among the ruins of the Amoritish town he found objects which
take us back to the time of Khu-n-Aten and his predecessors. They
consist of Egyptian beads and scarabs of the eighteenth dynasty,
and on one of the beads are the name and title of "the royal wife
Teie." Along with them were discovered beads of amber which came
from the Baltic as well as seal-cylinders, some of them imported
from Babylonia, others western imitations of Babylonian work. The
Babylonian cylinders belong to the period which extends from 3000
to 1500 B.C., while the imitations are similar in style to those
which have been found in the pre-historic tombs of Cyprus and
Phoenicia.</p>
<p>But there was one discovery made by Mr. Bliss which far
surpasses in interest all the rest. It is that of a cuneiform
tablet, similar in character, in contents, and in age to those
which have come from Tel el-Amarna. Even the Egyptian governor
mentioned in it was already known to us from the Tel el-Amarna
correspondence as the governor of <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page121" id="page121"></a>{121}</span> Lachish. One of the
cuneiform letters now preserved at Berlin was written by him, and
Ebed-Tob informs us that he was subsequently murdered by the people
of his own city.</p>
<p>Here is a translation of the letter discovered at Tel
el-Hesi:&mdash;</p>
<p>"To ... rabbat (?) [or perhaps: To the officer Baya] (thus
speaks) ... abi. At thy feet I prostrate myself. Verily thou
knowest that Dan-Hadad and Zimrida have inspected the whole of the
city, and Dan-Hadad says to Zimrida: Send Yisyara to me [and] give
me 3 shields (?) and 3 slings and 3 falchions, since I am prefect
(?) over the country of the king and it has acted against me; and
now I will restore thy possession which the enemy took from thee;
and I have sent my ..., and ... rabi-ilu ... has despatched his
brother [with] these words."</p>
<p>(This translation differs in some respects from that previously
given by me, as it is based on the copy of the text made from the
original at Constantinople by Dr. Scheil (<i>Recueil de Trailaux
relatifs &agrave; la Philologie et &agrave; l'Arch&eacute;ologie
&eacute;gyptiennes et assyriennes</i>, xv. 3, 4, 137). As I stated
at the time, my copy was made from a cast and was therefore
uncertain in several places. I am doubtful whether even now the
published text is correct throughout.)</p>
<p>Yisyara was the name of an Amorite, as we learn from one of the
Tel el-Amarna tablets, where he is mentioned along with other
rebels as being sent in fetters of bronze to the king. Of Dan-Hadad
we know nothing further, but Zimrida's letter is as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>"To the king my lord, my god, my Sun-god, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>{122}</span> the
Sun-god who is from heaven, thus (writes) Zimridi, the governor of
the city of Lachish. Thy servant, the dust of thy feet, at the feet
of the king my lord, the Sun-god from heaven, bows himself seven
times seven. I have very diligently listened to the words of the
messenger whom the king my lord has sent to me, and now I have
despatched (a mission) according to his message."</p>
<p>It was towards the end of Khu-n-Aten's reign, when the Egyptian
empire was falling to pieces, that the murder of Zimrida took
place. Ebed-Tob thus describes it in a letter to the secretary of
the Pharaoh: "The Khabiri (or Confederates) are capturing the
fortresses of the king. Not a single governor remains among them to
the king my lord; all are destroyed. Behold, Turbazu thy officer
[has fallen] in the great gate of the city of Zelah. Behold, the
servants who acted against the king have slain Zimrida of Lachish.
They have murdered Jephthah-Hadad thy officer in the gate of the
city of Zelah."</p>
<p>We hear of another governor of Lachish, Yabni-el by name, but he
probably held office before Zimrida. At all events the following
despatch of his has been preserved:&mdash;</p>
<p>"To the king my lord, my god, my Sun-god, the Sun-god who is
from heaven, thus (writes) Yabni-el, the governor of the city of
Lachish, thy servant, the dust of thy feet, the groom of thy
horses; at the feet of the king my lord, my god, my Sun-god, the
Sun-god who is from heaven, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page123"
id="page123"></a>{123}</span> seven times seven I bow myself.
Glorious and supreme [art thou]. I the groom of [the horses] of the
king my lord, listen to the [words] of the king my lord. Now have I
heard all the words which Baya the prefect has spoken to me. Now
have I done everything."</p>
<p>Zimrida of Lachish must be distinguished from another Canaanite
of the same name who was governor of Sidon. This latter was a
personal enemy of Rib-Hadad the governor of Gebal, whose letters to
Khu-n-Aten form a considerable portion of the Tel el-Amarna
collection. The authority of Rib-Hadad originally extended over the
greater part of Phoenicia, and included the strong fortress of
Zemar or Simyra in the mountains. One by one, however, his cities
were taken from him by his adversaries whom he accuses of rebellion
against the Pharaoh. His letters to Egypt are accordingly filled
with imploring appeals for help. But none was sent, and as his
enemies equally professed their loyalty to the Egyptian government,
it is doubtful whether this was because the Pharaoh suspected
Rib-Hadad himself of disaffection or because no troops could be
spared.</p>
<p>Rib-Hadad had been appointed to his post by Amenophis III., and
in one of his letters he looks back regretfully on "the good old
times." When his letters were written he was old and sick.
Abimelech, the governor of Tyre, was almost the only friend who
remained to him. Not content with fomenting rebellion in his
district, and taking <span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id=
"page124"></a>{124}</span> his cities from him, his enemies accused
him to the Pharaoh of disloyalty and misdoing. Those accusations
were in some cases founded on truth. He confesses to having fled
from his city, but he urges that it was to save his life. The
troops he had begged for had not been sent to him, and he could no
longer defend either his city or himself. He also alleges that the
excesses committed by some of his servants had been without his
knowledge. This seems to have been in answer to a despatch of
Ammunira, the prefect of Beyrout, in which he informed the king
that he was keeping the brother of the governor of Gebal as a
hostage, and that the latter had been intriguing against the
government in the land of the Amorites.</p>
<p>Chief among the adversaries of Rib-Hadad was Ebed-Asherah, a
native of the land of Barbarti, and the governor of the Amoritish
territory. Several of his sons are mentioned, but the ablest and
most influential of them was Aziru or Ezer, who possessed a
considerable amount of power. The whole family, while professing to
be the obedient servants of the Pharaoh, nevertheless acted with a
good deal of independence, and sought to aggrandise themselves at
the expense of the neighbouring governors. They had at their
disposal a large body of "plunderers," or Beduin from the eastern
desert, and Rib-Hadad accuses them of forming secret alliances with
the kings of Babylonia, of Mitanni and of the Hittites. The
authority of Aziru extended to the northern frontier of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id=
"page125"></a>{125}</span> empire; we find him sent with the
Egyptian general Khatip, or Hotep, to oppose the Hittite invasion,
and writing to the king as well as to the prime minister Dudu to
explain why they had not succeeded in doing so. Tunip had been
invested by the enemy, and Aziru fears that it may fall into their
hands. The Hittites had already made their way into the land of
Nukhasse, and were from thence marching up into the land of the
Amorites.</p>
<p>On the heels of these despatches came a long letter from the
people of Tunip, complaining of the conduct of Aziru, and
protesting against his doing to them what he had done to the city
of Ni. He was at the time in the land of the Hittites, doubtless
carrying on the war against the general enemy.</p>
<p>To these accusations Aziru made a full reply. "O my lord," he
begins, "hearken not to the wicked men who slander me before the
king my lord: I am thy servant for ever." He had been charged with
want of respect to the Pharaoh, on the ground that he had not
received the royal commissioner Khani on his arrival at Tunip. But,
he replies, he did not know that the commissioner was coming, and
as soon as he heard that he was on the road he "followed him, but
failed to overtake him." In his absence Khani was duly received by
the brethren of Aziru, and Belti-el (or Bethuel) furnished him with
meat and bread and wine. Moreover, on his way home he was met by
Aziru <span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id=
"page126"></a>{126}</span> himself, who provided the commissioner
with horses and mules. A more serious charge was that of seizing
the city of Zemar. To this Aziru answers that it was done in
self-defence, as the kings of Nukhasse had always been hostile to
him, and had robbed him of his cities at the instigation of Khatip,
who had also carried away all the silver and gold which the king
had placed under his care. Moreover he had not really seized Zemar,
but had won the people over to himself by means of gifts. Lastly,
he denied the accusation that he had received the envoy of the king
of the Hittites and refused to receive the Egyptian messenger,
although the country he governed belonged to the king, and the king
had appointed him over it. Let the Egyptian envoy make inquiries,
he urges, and he will find that Aziru has acted uprightly.</p>
<p>The capture of Zemar forms the burden of many of the letters of
Rib-Hadad. It had been besieged for two months by Ebed-Asherah, who
had vainly attempted to corrupt the loyalty of the governor of
Gebal. For the time Rib-Hadad managed to save the city, but Aziru
allied himself with Arvad and the neighbouring towns of Northern
Phoenicia, captured twelve of Rib-Hadad's men, demanded a ransom of
fifty pieces of silver for each of them, and seized the ships of
Zemar, Beyrout, and Sidon. The forces sent from Gebal to Zemar were
made prisoners by the Amorite chief at Abiliya, and the position of
Rib-Hadad daily became more desperate. Pa-Hor, the Egyptian
governor of Kumidi, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id=
"page127"></a>{127}</span> joined his opponents, and induced the
Sute or Beduin to attack his Sardinian guards. Yapa-Hadad, another
governor, followed the example of Pa-Hor, and Zimridi the governor
of Sidon had from the first been his enemy. Tyre alone remained
faithful to his cause, though an "Ionian" who had been sent there
on a mission from Egypt had handed over horses, chariots, and men
to Ebed-Asherah, and it was accordingly to Tyre that Rib-Hadad sent
his family for safety. Tyre, however, now began to suffer like
Gebal in consequence of the alliance between Zimridi and
Ebed-Asherah.</p>
<p>Zemar eventually fell into the hands of Ebed-Asherah and his
sons, its prefect Khayapa or Khaip being slain during the assault.
Abimelech, the governor of Tyre, accuses Zimridi of having been the
cause. Whether this were so or not, it placed the whole of Northern
Phoenicia under the government or the influence of the Amorite
chiefs. If Rib-Hadad spoke the truth, Ebed-Asherah had "sent to the
soldiers in Bit-Ninip, saying, 'Gather yourselves together, and let
us march up against Gebal, if therein are any who have saved
themselves from our hands, and we will appoint governors throughout
all the provinces;' so all the provinces went over to the Beduin."
Provisions began to be scarce in Gebal, and the governor writes to
Egypt for corn.</p>
<p>Rib-Hadad now threatened the Pharaoh with deserting to his
enemies if succour was not forth-coming immediately, and at the
same time he <span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id=
"page128"></a>{128}</span> appealed to Amon-apt and Khayapa, the
Egyptian commissioners who had been sent to inquire into the
condition of affairs in Canaan. The appeal was so far successful
that troops were despatched to Zemar. But it was too late: along
with Arka it had already been occupied by Ebed-Asherah, who
thereupon writes to the Pharaoh, protesting his loyalty to
Khu-n-Aten, declaring that he is "the house-dog" of the king, and
that he guards the land of the Amorites for "the king" his lord. He
further calls on the Egyptian commissioner Pakhanate, who had been
ordered to visit him, to bear witness that he was "defending" Zemar
and its fields for the king. That Pakhanate was friendly to
Ebed-Asherah may be gathered from a despatch of Rib-Hadad, in which
he accuses that officer of refusing to send any troops to the
relief of Gebal, and of looking on while Zemar fell. Ebed-Asherah
goes on to beg the king to come himself, and see with his own eyes
how faithful a governor he really was.</p>
<p>The letters of Abimelech of Tyre told a different tale, and the
unfortunate Pharaoh might well be excused if he was as much puzzled
as we are to know on which side the truth lay, or whether indeed it
lay on either. Abimelech had a grievance of his own. As soon as
Zimridi of Sidon learned that he had been appointed governor of
Tyre, he seized the neighbouring city of Usu, which seems to have
occupied the site of Pal&aelig;tyros on the mainland, thereby
depriving the Tyrians of their <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page129" id="page129"></a>{129}</span> supplies of wood, food, and
fresh water. The city of Tyre was at the time confined to a rocky
island, to which provisions and water had to be conveyed in boats.
Hence the hostile occupation of the town on the mainland caused
many of its inhabitants to die of want. To add to their
difficulties, the city was blockaded by the combined fleet of
Sidon, Arvad, and Aziru. Ilgi, "king of Sidon," seems to have fled
to Tyre for protection, while Abimelech reports that the king of
Hazor had joined the Beduin under Ebed-Asherah and his sons. It may
be noted that a letter of this very king of Hazor has been
preserved, as well as another from Ebed-Sullim, the Egyptian
governor of the city, whose powers were co-extensive with those of
the king.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards, however, the Sidonian ships were compelled to
retreat, and the Tyrian governor made ready to pursue them.
Meanwhile he sent his messenger Elimelech to Khu-n-Aten with
various presents, and gave the king an account of what had been
happening in "Canaan." The Hittite troops had departed, but
Etagama&mdash;elsewhere called Aidhu-gama&mdash;the <i>pa-ur</i> or
"prince" of Kadesh, in the land of Kinza, had joined Aziru in
attacking Namya-yitsa, the governor of Kumidi. Abimelech adds that
his rival Zimridi of Sidon had collected ships and men from the
cities of Aziru against him, and had consequently defeated him, but
if the Pharaoh would send only four companies of troops to his
rescue all would be well.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id=
"page130"></a>{130}</span>
<p>Zimridi, however, was not behindhand in forwarding his version
of events to the Egyptian court, and assuring the king of his
unswerving fidelity. "Verily the king my lord knows," he says,
"that the queen of the city of Sidon is the handmaid of the king my
lord, who has given her into my hand, and that I have hearkened to
the words of the king my lord that he would send to his servant,
and my heart rejoiced and my head was exalted, and my eyes were
enlightened, and my ears heard the words of the king my lord....
And the king my lord knows that hostility is very strong against
me; all the [fortresses] which the king gave into [my hand] had
revolted" to the Beduin, but had been retaken by the commander of
the Egyptian forces. The letter throws a wholly different light on
the relations of the two rival parties in Phoenicia.</p>
<p>The assertions of Rib-Hadad, however, are supported by those of
his successor in the government of Gebal, El-rabi-Hor. Rib-Hadad
himself disappears from the scene. He may have died, for he
complains that he is old and sick; he may have been driven out of
Gebal, for in one of his despatches he states that the city was
inclined to revolt, while in another he tells us that even his own
brother had turned against him and gone over to the Amorite
faction. Or he may have been displaced from his post; at all
events, we hear that the Pharaoh had written to him, saying that
Gebal was rebellious, and that there was a large amount
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id=
"page131"></a>{131}</span> of royal property in it. We hear also
that Rib-Hadad had sent his son to the Egyptian court to plead his
cause there, alleging age and infirmities as a reason for not going
himself. However it may have been, we find a new governor in Gebal,
who bears the hybrid name of El-rabi-Hor, "a great god is
Horus."</p>
<p>His first letter is to protest against Khu-n-Aten's mistrust of
Gebal, which he calls "thy city and the city of [thy] fathers," and
to assert roundly that "Aziru is in rebellion against the king my
lord." Aziru had made a league (?) with the kings of Ni, Arvad, and
Ammiya (the Beni-Ammo of Num. xxii. 5) (See above, p. <a href=
"#page64">64</a>.), and with the help of the Amorite Palasa was
destroying the cities of the Pharaoh. So El-rabi-Hor asks the king
not to heed anything the rebel may write about his seizure of Zemar
or his massacre of the royal governors, but to send some troops to
himself for the defence of Gebal. In a second letter he reiterates
his charges against Aziru, who had now "smitten" Adon, the king of
Arka, and possessed himself of Zemar and the other towns of
Phoenicia, so that Gebal "alone" is on the side of the king, who
"looks on" without doing anything. Moreover a fresh enemy had
arisen in the person of Eta-gama of Kadesh, who had joined himself
with the king of the Hittites and the king of Naharaim.</p>
<p>Letters to Khu-n-Aten from Akizzi the governor of Qatna, which,
as we learn from the inscriptions <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page132" id="page132"></a>{132}</span> of Assur-natsir-pal, was
situated on the Khab&ucirc;r, represent Aziru in the same light.
First of all, the Egyptian government is informed that the king of
the Hittites, together with Aidhu-gama (or Eta-gama) of Kadesh has
been invading the Egyptian territory, burning its cities, and
carrying away from Qatna the image of the Sun-god. Khu-n-aten, it
is urged, could not allow the latter crime to go unpunished. The
Sun-god had created him and his father, and had caused them to be
called after his own name. He was the supreme object of the
Pharaoh's worship, the deity for whose sake Khu-n-Aten had deserted
Thebes.</p>
<p>The Hittite king had been joined in his invasion of Syria by the
governors of some otherwise unknown northern cities, but the kings
of Nukhasse, Ni, Zinzar (the Sonzar of the Egyptian texts), and
Kinanat (the Kanneh of Ezek. xxvii. 23) remained faithful to the
Egyptian monarch. The rebel governors, however, were in the land of
Ube,&mdash;the Aup of the hieroglyphics,&mdash;which they were
urging Aidhu-gama to invade.</p>
<p>Another letter brings Aziru upon the scene. He is accused of
having invaded the land of Nukhasse, and made prisoners of the
people of Qatna. The Pharaoh is prayed to rescue or ransom them,
and to send chariots and soldiers to the help of his Mesopotamian
subjects. If they come all the lands round about will acknowledge
him as lord, and he will be lord also of Nukhasse; if they do not
come, the men of Qatna will be forced to obey Aziru.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id=
"page133"></a>{133}</span>
<p>It is probable that the misdeeds of Aziru which are here
referred to were committed at the time he was in Tunip, professedly
protecting it against Hittite attack. It would seem from what
Akizzi says, that instead of faithfully performing his mission, he
had aimed at establishing his own power in Northern Syria. While
nominally an officer of the Pharaoh, he was really seeking to found
an Amorite kingdom in the north. In this he would have been a
predecessor of Og and Sihon, whose kingdoms were built up on the
ruins of the Egyptian empire.</p>
<p>A despatch, however, from Namya-yitsa, the governor of Kumidi,
sets the conduct of Aziru in a more favourable light. It was
written at a somewhat later time, when rebellion against the
Egyptian authority was spreading throughout Syria. A certain
Biridasyi had stirred up the city of Inu'am, and after shutting its
gate upon Namya-yitsa had entered the city of Ashtaroth-Karnaim in
Bashan, and there seized the chariots belonging to the Pharaoh,
handing them over to the Beduin. He then joined the kings of
Buzruna (now Bosra) and Khalunni (near the Wadi 'All&acirc;n), in a
plot to murder Namya-yitsa, who escaped, however, to Damascus,
though his own brothers turned against him. The rebels next
attacked Aziru, captured some of his soldiers, and in league with
Etu-gama wasted the district of Abitu. Etakkama, however, as
Etu-gama spells his own name, professed to be a loyal servant of
the Egyptian king, and one of the Tel el-Amarna letters is from
him.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id=
"page134"></a>{134}</span>
<p>We next hear of Namya-yitsa in Accho or Acre, where he had taken
refuge with Suta, or Seti, the Egyptian commissioner. Seti had
already been in Jerusalem, and had been inquiring there into the
behaviour of Ebed-Tob.</p>
<p>The picture of incipient anarchy and rebellion which is set
before us by the correspondence from Phoenicia and Syria is
repeated in that from the centre and south of Palestine. In the
centre the chief seats of the Egyptian government were at Megiddo,
at Khazi (the Gaza of 1 Chron. vii. 28), near Shechem, and at
Gezer. Each of these towns was under an Egyptian governor,
specially appointed by the Pharaoh.</p>
<p>The governor of Khazi bore the name of Su-yarzana, Megiddo was
under the authority of Birid&icirc;, while the governor of Gaza was
Yapakhi. There are several letters in the Tel el-Amarna collection
from the latter official, chiefly occupied with demands for help
against his enemies. The district under his control was attacked by
the Sute or Beduin, led by a certain Labai or Labaya and his sons.
Labai, though of Beduin origin, was himself professedly an Egyptian
official, the Egyptian policy having been to give the title of
governor to the powerful Beduin sheikhs, and to attach them to the
Egyptian government by the combined influence of bribery and fear.
Labai accordingly writes to the Pharaoh to defend himself against
the charges that had been brought against him, and to assure
Khu-n-Aten that he was "a faithful servant <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>{135}</span> of the
king"; "I have not sinned, and I have not offended, and I do not
withhold my tribute or neglect the command to turn back my
officers." Labai, it would seem, had been appointed by Amenophis
III. governor of Shunem and Bene-berak (Joshua xix. 45), and had
captured the city of Gath-Rimmon when it revolted against the
Pharaoh; but after the death of Amenophis he and his two sons had
attacked the Egyptian officials in true Beduin style, and had taken
every opportunity of pillaging central and Southern Palestine. As
we shall see, Labai and his ally, Malchiel, were among the chief
adversaries of Ebed-Tob of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>On one occasion, however, Labai was actually made prisoner by
one of the Egyptian officers. There is a letter from Birid&icirc;
stating that Megiddo was threatened by Labai, and that although the
garrison had been strengthened by the arrival of some Egyptian
troops, it was impossible to venture outside the gates of the town
for fear of the enemy, and that unless two more regiments were sent
the city itself was likely to fall. Whether the additional forces
were sent or not we do not know. Labai, however, had to fly for his
life along with his confederate Yasdata, who was the governor of
some city near Megiddo, as we learn from a letter of his in which
he speaks of being with Birid&icirc;. Of Yasdata we hear nothing
further, but Labai was captured in Megiddo by Zurata, the prefect
of Acre, who, under the pretext that he was going to send
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id=
"page136"></a>{136}</span> his prisoner in a ship to Egypt, took
him first to the town of Khinatuna ('En'ath&ocirc;n), and then to
his own house, where he was induced by a bribe to set him free
along with his companion, Hadad-mekhir (who, by the way, has
bequeathed to us two letters).</p>
<p>It was probably after this that Labai wrote to the Pharaoh to
exculpate himself, though his language, in spite of its
conventional submissiveness, could not have been very acceptable at
the Egyptian court. In one of his letters he excuses himself partly
on the ground that even "the food of his stomach" had been taken
from him, partly that he had attacked and entered Gezer only in
order to recover the property of himself and his friend Malchiel,
partly because a certain Bin-sumya whom the Pharaoh had sent
against him had really "given a city and property in it to my
father, saying that if the king sends for my wife I shall withhold
her, and if the king sends for myself I shall give him instead a
bar of copper in a large bowl and take the oath of allegiance." A
second letter is still more uncompromising. In this he complains
that the Egyptian troops have ill-treated his people, and that the
officer who is with him has slandered him before the king; he
further declares that two of his towns have been taken from him,
but that he will defend to the last whatever still remains of his
patrimony.</p>
<p>Malchiel, the colleague of Labai in his attack upon Gezer, as
afterwards upon Ebed-Tob of Jerusalem, does not appear to have been
of Beduin origin. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id=
"page137"></a>{137}</span> But as long as the Beduin chief could be
of use to him he was very willing to avail himself of his
assistance, and it was always easy to drop the alliance as soon as
it became embarrassing. Malchiel was the son-in-law of Tagi of
Gath, and the colleague of Su-yardata, one of the few Canaanite
governors whom the Egyptian government seems to have been able to
trust. Both Su-yardata and Malchiel held commands in Southern
Palestine, and we hear a good deal about them from Ebed-Tob. "The
two sons of Malchiel" are also mentioned in a letter from a lady
who bears a Babylonian name, and who refers to them in connection
with an attempt to detach the cities of Ajalon and Zorah (Joshua
xv. 33) from their allegiance to Egypt. The female correspondents
of the Pharaoh are among the most curious and interesting features
of the state of society depicted in the Tel el-Amarna tablets; they
entered keenly into the politics of the day, and kept the Egyptian
king fully informed of all that was going on.</p>
<p>The letters of Ebed-Tob are so important that it is as well to
give them in full. They all seem to have been written within a few
months, or perhaps even weeks, of one another, when the enemies of
the governor of Jerusalem were gathering around him, and no
response came from Egypt to his requests for help. The dotted lines
mark the words and passages which have been lost through the
fracture of the clay tablets.</p>
<p>(I.) "To the king my lord [my] Sun-god, thus <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>{138}</span> [speaks]
Ebed-Tob thy servant: at the feet of the king my lord seven times
seven I prostrate myself. Behold, the king has established his name
at the rising of the sun and the setting of the sun. Slanders have
been uttered against me. Behold, I am not a governor, a vassal of
the king my lord. Behold, I am an ally of the king, and I have paid
the tribute due to the king, even I. Neither my father nor my
mother, but the oracle (or arm) of the Mighty King established [me]
in the house of [my] fathers.... There have come to me as a present
13 [women] and 10 slaves. Suta (Seti) the Commissioner of the king
has come to me: 21 female slaves and 20 male slaves captured in war
have been given into the hands of Suta as a gift for the king my
lord, as the king has ordained for his country. The country of the
king is being destroyed, all of it. Hostilities are carried on
against me as far as the mountains of Seir (Joshua xv. 10) and the
city of Gath-Karmel (Joshua xv. 55). All the other governors are at
peace, but there is war against myself, since I see the foe, but I
do not see the tears of the king my lord because war has been
raised against me. While there is a ship in the midst of the sea,
the arm (or oracle) of the Mighty King shall conquer the countries
of Naharaim (Nakhrima) and Babylonia. But now the Confederates
(Khabiri) are capturing the fortresses of the king. Not a single
governor remains among them to the king my lord; all have perished.
Behold, Turbazu, thy military officer, [has fallen] in <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>{139}</span> the great
gate of the city of Zelah (Josh, xviii. 28). Behold, Zimrida of
Lachish has been murdered by the servants who have revolted against
the king. Jephthah-Hadad, thy military officer, has been slain in
the great gate of Zelah.... May the king [my lord] send help [to
his country]! May the king turn his face to [his subjects]! May he
despatch troops to [his] country! [Behold,] if no troops come this
year, all the countries of the king my lord will be utterly
destroyed. They do not say before the face of the king my lord that
the country of the king my lord is destroyed, and that all the
governors are destroyed, if no troops come this year. Let the king
send a commissioner, and let him come to me, even to me, with
auxiliary troops, and we will die with the king [our]
lord.&mdash;[To] the secretary of the king my lord [speaks]
Ebed-Tob [thy] servant. At [thy] feet [I prostrate myself]. Let a
report of [my] words be laid before the king [my] lord. Thy [loyal]
servant am I."</p>
<p>(II.) "To the king my lord thus speaks Ebed-Tob thy servant: at
the feet of the king my lord seven times seven I prostrate myself.
What have I done against the king my lord? They have slandered me,
laying wait for me in the presence of the king, the lord, saying:
Ebed-Tob has revolted from the king his lord. Behold, neither my
father nor my mother has exalted me in this place; the prophecy of
the Mighty King has caused me to enter the house of my father. Why
should I have <span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id=
"page140"></a>{140}</span> committed a sin against the king the
lord? With the king my lord is life. I say to the officer of the
king [my] lord: Why dost thou love the Confederates and hate the
governors? And constantly I am sending to the presence of the king
my lord to say that the countries of the king my lord are being
destroyed. Constantly I am sending to the king my lord, and let the
king my lord consider, since the king my lord has appointed the men
of the guard who have taken the fortresses. Let Yikhbil-Khamu [be
sent].... Let the king send help to his country. [Let him send
troops] to his country which protects the fortresses of the king my
lord, all of them, since Elimelech is destroying all the country of
the king; and let the king send help to his country. Behold, I have
gone down along with the king my lord, and I have not seen the
tears of the king my lord; but hostility is strong against me, yet
I have not taken anything whatever from the king my lord; and let
the king incline towards my face; let him despatch a guard [for
me], and let him appoint a commissioner, and I shall not see the
tears of the king my lord, since the king [my] lord shall live when
the commissioner has departed. Behold, the countries of the king
[my lord] are being destroyed, yet thou dost not listen to me. All
the governors are destroyed; no governor remains to the king the
lord. Let the king turn his face to his subjects, and let him send
auxiliaries, even the troops of the king my lord. No provinces
remain unto the king; <span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id=
"page141"></a>{141}</span> the confederates have wasted all the
provinces of the king. If auxiliaries come this year, the provinces
of the king the lord will be preserved; but if no auxiliaries come
the provinces of the king my lord are destroyed.&mdash;[To] the
secretary of the king my lord Ebed-Tob [says:] Give a report of my
words to the king my lord: the provinces of the king my lord are
being destroyed by the enemy."</p>
<p>(III.) "[To] the king my lord [speaks] Ebed-Tob [thy] servant:
[at the feet of the king] my lord seven [times seven I prostrate
myself. Behold, let] the king [listen to] the words [of his
servant].... Let [the king] consider all the districts which are
leagued in hostility against me, and let the king send help to his
country. Behold, the country of the city of Gezer, the country of
the city of Ashkelon and the city of La[chish] have given as their
peace offerings food and oil and whatsoever the fortress needs. And
let the king send help to his troops; let him despatch troops
against the men who have rebelled against the king my lord. If
troops come this year, there will remain both provinces [and]
governors to the king my lord; [but] if no troops arrive, there
will remain no provinces or governors to the king [my lord].
Behold, neither my father nor my mother has given this country of
the city of Jerusalem unto me: it was an oracle [of the Mighty
King] that gave it to me, even to me. Behold, Malchiel and the sons
of Labai have given the country of the king to the <span class=

Confederates. Behold, the king my lord is righteous towards me. As
to the Babylonians, let the king ask the commissioner how very
strong is the temple-[fortress of Jerusalem.].... Thou hast
delivered (?) the provinces into the hands of the city of
Ash[kelon]. Let the king demand of them abundance of food,
abundance of oil, and abundance of wine until Pa-ur, the
commissioner of the king, comes up to the country of the city of
Jerusalem to deliver Adai along with the garrison and the [rest of
the people]. Let the king consider the [instructions] of the king;
[let him] speak to me; let Adai deliver me&mdash;Thou wilt not
desert it, even this city, sending to me a garrison [and] sending a
royal commissioner. Thy grace [is] to send [them]. To the king [my
lord] I have despatched [a number of] prisoners [and a number of]
slaves. [I have looked after] the roads of the king in the plain
(<i>kikkar</i>, Gen. xiii. 10) and in the mountains. Let the king
my lord consider the city of Ajalon. I am not able to direct my way
to the king my lord according to his instructions. Behold, the king
has established his name in the country of Jerusalem for ever, and
he cannot forsake the territories of the city of
Jerusalem.&mdash;To the secretary of the king my lord thus speaks
Ebed-Tob thy servant. At thy feet I prostrate myself. Thy servant
am I. Lay a report of my words before the king my lord. The vassal
of the king am I. Mayest thou live long!&mdash;And thou hast
performed deeds which I cannot enumerate against the men

the country of the Babylonians [shall never enter] into my
house...."</p>
<p>(IV.) (The beginning of the letter is lost, and it is not
certain that Ebed-Tob was the writer of it.) "And now as to the
city of Jerusalem, if this country is still the king's, why is Gaza
made the seat of the king's government? Behold, the district of the
city of Gath-Carmel has fallen away to Tagi and the men of Gath. He
is in Bit-Sani (Beth-Sannah), and we have effected that they should
give Labai and the country of the Sute to the men of the district
of the Confederates. Malchiel has sent to Tagi and has seized some
boy-slaves. He has granted all their requests to the men of Keilah,
and we have delivered (or departed from) the city of Jerusalem. The
garrison thou hast left in it is under the command of Apis the son
of Miya-riya (Meri-Ra). Hadad-el has remained in his house in
Gaza...."</p>
<p>(V.) "To the king my lord thus [speaks] Ebed-Tob thy servant: at
the feet of my lord [the king] seven times seven [I prostrate
myself]. Behold, Malchiel does not separate himself from the sons
of Labai and the sons of Arzai to demand the country of the king
for themselves. As for the governor who acts thus, why does not the
king question him? Behold, Malchiel and Tagi are they who have
acted so, since they have taken the city of Rubute (Rabbah, Josh.
xv. 60).... (Many lines are lost here.) There is no royal

<p>(VI.) "[To] the king my lord thus speaks Ebed-Tob thy servant:

myself. [The king knows the deed] which they have done, even
Malchiel and Su-ardatum, against the country of the king my lord,
commanding the forces of the city of Gezer, the forces of the city
of Gath, and the forces of the city of Keilah. They have seized the
district of the city of Rabbah. The country of the king has gone
over to the Confederates. And now at this moment the city of the
mountain of Jerusalem, the city of the temple of the god Nin-ip,
whose name is Salim (?)," (Or, adopting the reading of Dr. Zimmern,
"The city whose name is Bit-Nin-ip.") "the city of the king, is
gone over to the side of the men of Keilah. Let the king listen to

the Confederates. This is the deed [of Su-ar]datun and
Malchiel...."</p>
<p>The loyalty of Ebed-Tob, however, seems to have been doubted at
the Egyptian court, where more confidence was placed in his rival
and enemy Su-ardata (or Su-yardata, as the owner of the name
himself writes it). Possibly the claim of the vassal-king of
Jerusalem to have been appointed to his royal office by the "Mighty
King" rather than by the "great king" of Egypt, and consequently to
be an ally of the Pharaoh and not an ordinary governor, may have
had something to do with the suspicions that were entertained of
him. At all events we learn from a letter of Su-yardata that the
occupation of Keilah by Ebed-Tob's enemies, of which the latter
complains so bitterly, was due to the orders of the Egyptian
government itself. Su-yardata there says&mdash;"The king [my lord]
directed me to make war in the city of Keilah: war was made; (and
now) a complaint is brought against me. My city against myself has
risen upon me. Ebed-Tob sends to the men of the city of Keilah; he
sends silver, and they have marched against my rear. And the king
knows that Ebed-Tob has taken my city from my hand." The writer
adds that "now Labai has taken Ebed-Tob and they have taken our
cities." In his subsequent despatches to the home government
Su-yardata complains that he is "alone," and asks that troops
should be sent to him, saying that he is forwarding some
<i>almehs</i> or maidens as a <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page146" id="page146"></a>{146}</span> present along with his
"dragoman." At this point the correspondence breaks off.</p>
<p>Malchiel and Tagi also write to the Pharaoh. According to Tagi
the roads between Southern Palestine and Egypt were under the
supervision and protection of his brother; while Malchiel begs for
cavalry to pursue and capture the enemy who had made war upon
Su-yardata and himself, had seized "the country of the king," and
threatened to slay his servants. He also complains of the conduct
of Yankhamu, the High Commissioner, who had been ordered to inquire
into the conduct of the governors in Palestine. Yankhamu, it seems,
had seized Malchiel's property and carried off his wives and
children. It was doubtless to this act of injustice that Labai
alludes in his letter of exculpation.</p>
<p>The territory of which Jerusalem was the capital extended
southward as far as Carmel of Judah, Gath-Carmel as it is called by
Ebed-Tob, as well as in the geographical lists of Thothmes III.,
while on the west it reached to Keilah, Kabbah, and Mount Seir. No
mention is made of Hebron either in the Tel el-Amarna letters or in
the Egyptian geographical lists, which are earlier than the rise of
the nineteenth dynasty. The town must therefore have existed under
some other name, or have been in the hands of a power hostile to
Egypt.</p>
<p>The name of Hebron has the same origin as that of the Khabiri,
who appear in Ebed-Tob's letters by the side of Labai, Babylonia,
and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id=
"page147"></a>{147}</span> Naharaim as the assailants of Jerusalem
and its territory. The word means "Confederates," and occurs in the
Assyrian texts; among other passages in a hymn published by Dr.
Br&uuml;nnow, where we read, <i>istu pan khabiri-ya iptarsanni</i>,
"from the face of my associates he has cut me off." The word,
however, is not Assyrian, as in that case it would have had a
different form, but must have been borrowed from the Canaanitish
language of the West.</p>
<p>Who the Khabiri or "Confederates" were has been disputed. Some
scholars see in them Elamite marauders who followed the march of
the Babylonian armies to Syria. This opinion is founded on the fact
that the Khabiri are once mentioned as an Elamite tribe, and that
in a Babylonian document a "Khabirite" (<i>Khabir&acirc;</i>) is
referred to along with a "Kassite" or Babylonian. Another view is
that they are to be identified with Heber, the grandson of Asher
(Gen. xlvi. 17), since Malchiel is said to be the brother of Heber,
just as in the letters of Ebed-Tob Malchiel is associated with the
Khabiri. But all such identifications are based upon the
supposition that "Khabiri" is a proper name rather than a
descriptive title. Any band of "Confederates" could be called
Khabiri whether in Elam or in Palestine, and it does not follow
that the two bands were the same. In the "Confederates" of Southern
Canaan we have to look for a body of confederated tribes who made
themselves formidable to the governor of Jerusalem in the closing
days of the Egyptian empire.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id=
"page148"></a>{148}</span>
<p>It would seem that Elimelech, who of course was a different
person from Malchiel, was their leader, and as Elimelech is a
Canaanitish name, we may conclude that the majority of his
followers were also of Canaanitish descent. The scene of their
hostilities was to the south of Jerusalem. Gath-Carmel, Zelah, and
Lachish are the towns mentioned in connection with their attempts
to capture and destroy "the fortresses of the king." "The country
of the king" which had "gone over to the Confederates" was the
territory over which Ebed-Tob claimed rule, while the district
occupied by Labai and his Beduin followers was handed over "to the
men of the district of the Confederates." The successes of the
latter were gained through the intrigues of Malchiel and the sons
of Labai.</p>
<p>All this leads us to the neighbourhood of Hebron, and suggests
the question whether "the district of the Confederates" was not
that of which Hebron, "the Confederacy," was the central
meeting-place and sanctuary. Hebron has preserved its sacred
character down to the present day; it long disputed with Jerusalem
the claim of being the oldest and most hallowed shrine in Southern
Palestine, and it was for many years the capital of Judah,
Moreover, we know that "Hebron" was not the only name the city
possessed. When Abram was "confederate" with the three Amorite
chieftains it was known as Mamre (Gen. xiii. 18), and at a later
day under the rule of the three sons of Anak it was called
Kirjath-Arba.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id=
"page149"></a>{149}</span>
<p>According to the Biblical narrative Hebron was at once Amorite,
Hittite, and Canaanite. Here, therefore, there was a confederation
of tribes and races who would have met together at a common
sanctuary. When Ezekiel says that Jerusalem was both Hittite and
Amorite in its parentage, he may have been referring to its
conquest and settlement by such a confederacy as that of Hebron. At
all events we learn from Su-yardata's letter that Ebed-Tob
eventually fell into the hands of his enemies; he was captured by
Labai, and it is possible that his city became at the same time the
prey of the Khabiri.</p>
<p>But all this is speculation, which may or may not prove to be
correct. All we can be sure of is that the Khabiri or
"Confederates" had their seat in the southern part of Palestine,
and that we need not go outside Canaan to discover who they were.
Ebed-Tob, at all events, carefully distinguishes them from either
the Babylonians or the people of Naharaim.</p>
<p>In his letters, as everywhere else in the Tel el-Amarna
correspondence, the Babylonians are called Kassi or Kassites. The
name is written differently in the cuneiform texts from that of the
Ethiopians, the Kash of the hieroglyphic inscriptions. Both,
however, are alike represented in Hebrew by Cush, and hence we have
not only a Cush who is the brother of Mizrairn, but also another
Cush who is the father of Nimrod. The name of the latter takes us
back to the age of the Tel el-Amarna tablets.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id=
"page150"></a>{150}</span>
<p>Nahrima, or Naharaim, was the name by which the kingdom of
Mitanni was known to its Canaanite and Egyptian neighbours.
Mitanni, in fact, was its capital, and it may be that Lutennu (or
Lotan), as the Egyptians called Syria and Palestine, was but a
mispronunciation of it. Along with the Babylonians the people of
Naharaim had made themselves formidable to the inhabitants of
Canaan, and their name was feared as far south as Jerusalem. Even
the governor of the Canaanite town of Musikhuna, not far from the
Sea of Galilee, bore the Mitannian name of Sutarna. It was not,
indeed, until after the Israelitish conquest that the last invasion
of Canaan by a king of Aram-Naharaim took place.</p>
<p>Gaza and Joppa were at one time under the same governor,
Yabitiri, who in a letter which has come down to us asks to be
relieved of the burden of his office. Ashkelon, however, which lay
between the two sea-ports, was in the hands of another prefect,
Yidya by name, from whom we have several letters, in one of which
mention is made of the Egyptian commissioner Rianap, or Ra-nofer.
The jurisdiction of Rianap extended as far north as the plain of
Megiddo, since he is also referred to by Pu-Hadad, the governor of
Yurza, now Yerzeh, south-eastward of Taanach. But it was more
particularly in the extreme south of Palestine that the duties of
this officer lay. Hadad-dan, who was entrusted with the government
of Manahath and Tamar, to the west of the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>{151}</span> Dead Sea,
calls him "my Commissioner" in a letter in which he complains of
the conduct of a certain Beya, the son of "the woman Gulat."
Hadad-dan begins by saying that he had protected the commissioner
and cities of the king, and then adds that "the city of Tumur is
hostile to me, and I have built a house in the city of Mankhate, so
that the household troops of the king my lord may be sent to me;
and lo, B&acirc;ya has taken it from my hand, and has placed his
commissioner in it, and I have appealed to Rianap, my commissioner,
and he has restored the city unto me, and has sent the household
troops of the king my lord to me." After this the writer goes on to
state that Beya had also intrigued against the city of Gezer, "the
handmaid of the king my lord who created me." The rebel then
carried off a quantity of plunder, and it became necessary to
ransom his prisoners for a hundred pieces of silver, while those of
his confederate were ransomed for thirty pieces of silver.</p>
<p>The misdeeds of Beya or B&acirc;ya did not end here. We hear of
him again as attacking and capturing a body of soldiers who had
been sent to defend the royal palace at Joppa, and as occupying
that city itself. He was, however, subsequently expelled from it by
the king's orders. Beya, too, professed to be an Egyptian governor
and a faithful servant of the Pharaoh, to whom he despatched a
letter to say that Yankhamu, the High Commissioner, was not in his
district. Probably this was in answer to <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>{152}</span> a charge
brought against him by the Egyptian officer.</p>
<p>The official duties of Yankhamu extended over the whole of
Palestine, and all the governors of its cities were accountable to
him. We find him exercising his authority not only in the south,
but also in the north, at Zemar and Gebal, and even among the
Amorites. Amon-apt, to whom the superintendence of Phoenicia was
more particularly entrusted, was supplied by him with corn, and
frequent references are made to him in the letters of Rib-Hadad.
Malchiel complained of his high-handed proceedings, and the
complaint seems to have led to some confidential inquiries on the
part of the home government, since we find a certain Sibti-Hadad
writing in answer to the Pharaoh's questions that Yankhamu was a
faithful servant of the king.</p>
<p>The country east of the Jordan also appears to have been within
his jurisdiction. At all events the following letter was addressed
to him by the governor Mut-Hadad, "the man of Hadad." "To Yankhamu
my lord thus speaks Mut-Hadad thy servant: at the feet of my lord I
prostrate myself. Since Mut-Hadad has declared in thy presence that
Ayab has fled, and it is certified (?) that the king of Bethel has
fled from before the officers of the king his lord, may the king my
lord live, may the king my lord live! I pray thee ask Ben-enima,
ask ... tadua, ask Isuya, if Ay&acirc;b has been in this city of
Bethel for [the last] two months. Ever <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>{153}</span> since the
arrival of [the image of] the god Merodach, the city of Astarti
(Ashtaroth-Karnaim) has been assisted, because all the fortresses
of the foreign land are hostile, namely, the cities of Udumu
(Edom), Aduri (Addar), Araru, Mestu (Mosheh), Magdalim (Migdol),
Khinianabi ('En han-nabi), Zarki-tsabtat, Khaini ('En), and
Ibi-limma (Abel). Again after thou hadst sent a letter to me I sent
to him (<i>i.e.</i> Ay&acirc;b), [to wait] until thy arrival from
thy journey; and he reached the city of Bethel and [there] they
heard the news."</p>
<p>We learn from this letter that Edom was a "foreign country"
unsubdued by the Egyptian arms. The "city of Edom," from which the
country took its name, is again mentioned in the inscriptions of
the Assyrian king Esar-haddon, and it was there that the Assyrian
tax-gatherers collected the tribute of the Edomite nation. It would
seem that the land of Edom stretched further to the north in the
age of Khu-n-Aten than it did at a subsequent period of history,
and that it encroached upon what was afterwards the territory of
Moab. The name of the latter country is met with for the first time
among the Asiatic conquests of Ramses II. engraved on the base of
one of the colossal figures which stand in front of the northern
pylon of the temple of Luxor; when the Tel el-Amarna letters were
written Moab was included in the Canaanite province of Egypt.</p>
<p>A curious letter to Khu-n-Aten from Burnaburyas, the Babylonian
king, throws a good deal <span class="pagenum"><a name="page154"
id="page154"></a>{154}</span> of light on the nature of the
Egyptian government in Canaan. Between the predecessors of the two
monarchs there had been alliance and friendly intercourse, and
nevertheless the Canaanitish subjects of the Pharaoh had committed
an outrageous crime against some Babylonian merchants, which if
left unpunished would have led to a rupture between the two
countries. The merchants in question had entered Palestine under
the escort of the Canaanite Ahitub, intending afterwards to visit
Egypt. At &Ecirc;n-ath&ocirc;n, near Acre, however, "in the country
of Canaan," Sum-Adda, or Shem-Hadad, the son of Balumme (Balaam),
and Sutatna, or Zid-athon, the son of Saratum, [His name is written
Zurata in the letter of Birid&icirc;, the governor of Megiddo; see
above, p. <a href="#page135">135</a>.] who was governor of Acre,
set upon them, killing some of them, maltreating others, and
carrying away their goods. Burna-buryas therefore sent a special
envoy, who was instructed to lay the following complaint before the
Pharaoh: "Canaan is thy country and the king [of Acre is thy
servant]. In thy country I have been injured; do thou punish [the
offenders]. The silver which they carried off was a present [for
thee], and the men who are my servants they have slain. Slay them
and requite the blood [of my servants]. But if thou dost not put
these men to death, [the inhabitants] of the high-road that belongs
to me will turn and verily will slay thy ambassadors, and a breach
will be made in the agreement to respect the persons of
ambassadors, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id=
"page155"></a>{155}</span> and I shall be estranged from thee.
Shem-Hadad, having cut off the feet of one of my men, has detained
him with him; and as for another man, Sutatna of Acre made him
stand upon his head and then stood upon his face."</p>
<p>There are three letters in the Tel el-Amarna collection from
Sutatna, or Zid-atna ("the god Zid has given") as he writes his
name, in one of which he compares Akku or Acre with "the city of
Migdol in Egypt." Doubtless satisfaction was given to the
Babylonian king for the wrong that had been done to his subjects,
though whether the actual culprits were punished may be questioned.
There is another letter from Burna-buryas, in which reference is
again made to the Canaanites. He there asserts that in the time of
his father, Kurigalzu, they had sent to the Babylonian sovereign,
saying: "Go down against Qannisat and let us rebel." Kuri-galzu,
however, had refused to listen to them, telling them that if they
wanted to break away from the Egyptian king and ally themselves
"with another," they must find some one else to assist them.
Burna-buryas goes on to declare that he was like-minded with his
father, and had accordingly despatched an Assyrian vassal to assure
the Pharaoh that he would carry on no intrigues with disaffected
Canaanites. As the first part of his letter is filled with requests
for gold for the adornment of a temple he was building at Babylon,
such an assurance was very necessary. The despatches of Rib-Hadad
and Ebed-Tob, however, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id=
"page156"></a>{156}</span> go to show that in spite of his
professions of friendship, the Babylonian monarch was ready to
afford secret help to the insurgents in Palestine. The Babylonians
were not likely to forget that they had once been masters of the
country, or to regard the Egyptian empire in Asia with other than
jealous eyes.</p>
<p>The Tel el-Amarna correspondence breaks off suddenly in the
midst of a falling empire, with its governors in Canaan fighting
and intriguing one against the other, and appealing to the Pharaoh
for help that never came. The Egyptian commissioners are vainly
endeavouring to restore peace and order, like General Gordon in the
Soudan, while Babylonians and Mitannians, Hittites and Beduin are
assailing the distracted province. The Asiatic empire of the
eighteenth dynasty, however, did not wholly perish with the death
of Khu-n-Aten. A picture in the tomb of prince Hui at Thebes shows
that under the reign of his successor, Tut-ankh-Amon, the Egyptian
supremacy was still acknowledged in some parts of Syria. The chiefs
of the Lotan or Syrians are represented in their robes of many
colours, some with white and others with brown skins, and coming
before the Egyptian monarch with the rich tribute of their country.
Golden trays full of precious stones, vases of gold and silver, the
covers of which are in the form of the heads of gazelles and other
animals, golden rings richly enamelled, horses, lions, and a
leopard's skin&mdash;such are the gifts which they offer to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id=
"page157"></a>{157}</span> Pharaoh. It was the last embassy of the
kind which was destined to come from Syria for many a day.</p>
<p>With the rise of the nineteenth dynasty and the restoration of a
strong government at home, the Egyptians once more began to turn
their eyes towards Palestine. Seti I. drove the Beduin before him
from the frontiers of Egypt to those of "Canaan," and established a
line of fortresses and wells along "the way of the Philistines,"
which ran by the shore of the Mediterranean to Gaza. The road was
now open for him to the north along the sea-coast. We hear
accordingly of his capture of Acre, Tyre, and Usu or
Pal&aelig;tyros, from whence he marched into the Lebanon and took
Kumidi and Inu'am. One of his campaigns must have led him into the
interior of Palestine, since in his list of conquered cities we
find the names of Carmel and Beth-anoth, of Beth-el and Pahil or
Pella, as well as of Qamham or Chimham (see Jer. xli. 17). Kadesh,
"in the land of the Amorites," was captured by a sudden assault,
and Seti claims to have defeated or received the submission of
Alasiya and Naharaim, the Hittites and the Assyrians, Cyprus and
Sangar. It would seem, however, that north of Kadesh he really made
his way only along the coast as far as the Gulf of Antioch and
Cilicia, overrunning towns and districts of which we know little
more than the names.</p>
<p>Seti was succeeded by his son Ramses II., the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>{158}</span> Pharaoh
of the Oppression, and the builder of Pithom and Ramses. His long
reign of sixty-seven years lasted from 1348 B.C. to 1281 B.C. The
first twenty-one years of it were occupied in the re-conquest of
Palestine, and sanguinary wars with the Hittites. But these
mountaineers of the north had established themselves too firmly in
the old Egyptian province of Northern Syria to be dislodged. All
the Pharaoh could effect was to stop their further progress towards
the south, and to save Canaan from their grasp. The war between the
two great powers of Western Asia ended at last through the sheer
exhaustion of the rival combatants. A treaty of alliance, offensive
and defensive, was drawn up between Ramses II. and Khata-sil, "the
great king of the Hittites," and it was cemented by the marriage of
the Pharaoh to the daughter of the Hittite prince. Syria was
divided between the Hittites and Egyptians, and it was agreed that
neither should under any pretext invade the territories of the
other. It was also agreed that if either country was attacked by
foreign foes or rebellious subjects, the other should come to its
help. Political refugees, moreover, were to be delivered up to the
sovereign from whom they had escaped, but it was stipulated that in
this case they should receive a full pardon for the offences they
had committed. The Hittite copy of the treaty was engraved on a
silver plate, and the gods of Egypt and the Hittites were called
upon to witness the execution of it.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id=
"page159"></a>{159}</span>
<p>The legendary exploits of Sesostris, that creation of Greek
fancy and ignorance, were fastened upon Ramses II., whose long
reign, inordinate vanity, and ceaseless activity as a builder made
him one of the most prominent of the old Pharaohs. It was natural,
therefore, at the beginning of hieroglyphic decipherment that the
Greek accounts should be accepted in full, and that Ramses II.
should have been regarded as the greatest of Egyptian conquerors.
But further study soon showed that, in this respect at least, his
reputation had little to support it. Like his monuments, too many
of which are really stolen from his predecessors, or else sacrifice
honesty of work to haste and pretentiousness, a large part of the
conquests and victories that have been claimed for him was due to
the imagination of the scribes. In the reaction which followed on
this discovery, the modern historians of ancient Egypt were
disposed to dispute his claim to be a conqueror at all. But we now
know that such a scepticism was exaggerated, and though Ramses II.
was not a conqueror like Thothmes III., he nevertheless maintained
and extended the Asiatic empire which his father had recovered, and
the lists of vanquished cities which he engraved on the walls of
his temples were not mere repetitions of older catalogues, or the
empty fictions of flattering chroniclers. Egyptian armies really
marched once more into Northern Syria and the confines of Cilicia,
and probably made their way to the banks of the Euphrates. We have
no <span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id=
"page160"></a>{160}</span> reason for denying that Assyrian troops
may have been defeated by his arms, or that the king of Mitanni may
have sent an embassy to his court. And we now have a good deal more
than the indirect evidence of the treaty with the Hittites to show
that Canaan was again a province of the Egyptian empire. The names
of some of its cities which were captured in the early part of the
Pharaoh's reign may still be read on the walls of the Ramesseum at
Thebes. Among them are Ashkelon, Shalam or Jerusalem, Merom, and
Beth-Anath, which were taken by storm in his eighth year. Dapul,
"in the land of the Amorites," was captured at the same time,
proving that the Egyptian forces penetrated as far as the Hittite
frontiers. At Luxor other Canaanite names figure in the catalogue
of vanquished states. Thus we have Carmel of Judah, Ir-shemesh and
Hadashah (Josh. xv. 37), Gaza, Sela and Jacob-el, Socho, Yurza, and
Korkha in Moab. The name of Moab itself appears for the first time
among the subject nations, while we gather from a list of mining
settlements, that Cyprus as well as the Sinaitic peninsula was
under Egyptian authority.</p>
<p>A sarcastic account of the misadventures of a military officer
in Palestine, which was written in the time of Ramses, is an
evidence of the complete occupation of that country by the
Egyptians. All parts of Canaan are alluded to in it, and as Dr. Max
M&uuml;ller has lately pointed out, we find in it for the first
time the names of Shechem and <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page161" id="page161"></a>{161}</span> Kirjath-Sepher. Similar
testimony is borne by a hieroglyphic inscription recently
discovered by Dr. Schumacher on the so-called "Stone of Job" in the
Haur&acirc;n. The stone (<i>Sakhrat 'Ayyub</i>) is a monolith
westward of the Sea of Galilee, and not far from Tel 'Ashtereh, the
ancient Ashtaroth-Karnaim, which was a seat of Egyptian government
in the time of Khu-n-Aten. The monolith is adorned with Egyptian
sculptures and hieroglyphs. One of the sculptures represents a
Pharaoh above whose likeness is the cartouche of Ramses II., while
opposite the king, to the left, is the figure of a god who wears
the crown of Osiris, but has a full face. Over the god is his name
in hieroglyphics. The name, however, is not Egyptian, but seems to
be intended for the Canaanite Yakin-Zephon or "Yakin of the North."
It is plain, therefore, that we have here a monument testifying to
the rule of Ramses II., but a monument which was erected by natives
of the country to a native divinity. For a while the hieroglyphic
writing of Egypt had taken the place formerly occupied by the
cuneiform syllabary of Babylonia, and Egyptian culture had
succeeded in supplanting that which had come from the East.</p>
<p>The nineteenth dynasty ended even more disastrously than the
eighteenth. It is true that the great confederacy of northern and
Libyan tribes which attacked Egypt by sea and land in the reign of
Meneptah, the son and successor of Ramses II., was successfully
repulsed, but the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id=
"page162"></a>{162}</span> energy of the Egyptian power seemed to
exhaust itself in the effort. The throne fell into the hands of
usurpers, and the house of Ramses was swept away by civil war and
anarchy. The government was seized by a Syrian, Arisu by name, and
for a time Egypt was compelled to submit to a foreign yoke. The
overthrow of the foreigner and the restoration of the native
monarchy was due to the valour of Set-nekht, the founder of the
twentieth dynasty and the father of Ramses III.</p>
<p>It was under one of the immediate successors of Ramses II. that
the exodus of the Israelites out of Egypt must have taken place.
Egyptian tradition pointed to Meneptah; modern scholars incline
rather to his successors Seti II. and Si-Ptah. With this event the
patriarchal history of Canaan ought properly to come to an end. But
the Egyptian monuments still cast light upon it, and enable us to
carry it on almost to the moment when Joshua and his followers
entered the Promised Land.</p>
<p>Palestine still formed part of the kingdom of Meneptah, at all
events in the earlier years of his reign. A scribe has left us a
record of the officials who passed to and from Canaan through the
frontier fortress of Zaru during the middle of the month Pakhons in
the third year of the king. One of these was Baal- ... the son of
Zippor of Gaza, who carried a letter for the Egyptian overseer of
the Syrian peasantry (or Perizzites), as well as another for
Baal-[sa]lil-ga[b]u, the vassal-prince of Tyre. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>{163}</span> Another
messenger was Sutekh-mes, the son of 'Aper-dagar, who also carried
a despatch to the overseer of the peasantry, while a third envoy
came in the reverse direction, from the city of Meneptah, "in the
land of the Amorites."</p>
<p>In the troubles which preceded the accession of the twentieth
dynasty the Asiatic possessions of Egypt were naturally lost, and
were never again recovered. Ramses III., however, the last of the
conquering Pharaohs, made at least one campaign in Palestine and
Syria. Like Meneptah, he had to bear the brunt of an attack upon
Egypt by the confederated hordes of the north which threatened to
extinguish its civilization altogether. The nations of Asia Minor
and the &AElig;gean Sea had poured into Syria as the northern
barbarians in later days poured into the provinces of the Roman
Empire. Partly by land, partly by sea, they made their way through
Phoenicia and the land of the Hittites, destroying everything as
they went, and carrying in their train the subjugated princes of
Naharaim and Kadesh. For a time they encamped in the "land of the
Amorites," and then pursued their southward march. Ramses III. met
them on the north-eastern frontier of his kingdom, and in a
fiercely-contested battle utterly overthrew them. The ships of the
invaders were captured or sunk, and their forces on land were
decimated. Immense quantities of booty and prisoners were taken,
and the shattered forces of the enemy retreated into Syria. There
the Philistines and Zakkal possessed themselves of the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>{164}</span>
sea-coast, and garrisoned the cities of the extreme south. Gaza
ceased to be an Egyptian fortress, and became instead an effectual
barrier to the Egyptian occupation of Canaan.</p>
<p>When Ramses III. followed the retreating invaders of his country
into Syria, it is doubtful whether the Philistines had as yet
settled themselves in their future home. At all events Gaza fell
into his hands, and he found no difficulty in marching along the
Mediterranean coast like the conquering Pharaohs who had preceded
him. In his temple palace at Med&icirc;net Habu he has left a
record of the conquests that he made in Syria. The great cities of
the coast were untouched. No attempt was made to besiege or capture
Tyre and Sidon, Beyrout and Gebal, and the Egyptian army marched
past them, encamping on the way only at such places as "the
headland of Carmel," "the source of the Magoras," or river of
Beyrout, and the Bor or "Cistern." Otherwise its resting-places
were at unknown villages like Inzath and Lui-el. North of Beyrout
it struck eastward through the gorge of the Nahr el-Kelb, and took
the city of Kumidi. Then it made its way by Shenir or Hermon to
Hamath, which surrendered, and from thence still northward to "the
plain" of Aleppo.</p>
<p>In the south of Palestine, in what was afterwards the territory
of Judah, Ramses made yet another campaign. Here he claims to have
taken Lebanoth and Beth-Anath, Carmel of Judah and Shebtin,
Jacob-el and Hebron, Libnah and Aphek, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>{165}</span>
Migdal-gad and Ir-Shemesh, Hadashah and the district of Salem or
Jerusalem. From thence the Egyptian forces proceeded to the Lake of
Reshpon or the Dead Sea, and then crossing the Jordan seized Korkha
in Moab. But the campaign was little more than a raid; it left no
permanent results behind it, and all traces of Egyptian authority
disappeared with the departure of the Pharaoh's army. Canaan
remained the prey of the first resolute invader who had strength
and courage at his back.</p>

<h2><a name="chap4" id="chap4">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>
<h3>THE PATRIARCHS</h3>
<p>Abraham had been born in "Ur of the Chaldees." Ur lay on the
western side of the Euphrates in Southern Babylonia, where the
mounds of Muqayyar or Mugheir mark the site of the great temple
that had been reared to the worship of the Moon-god long before the
days of the Hebrew patriarch. Here Abraham had married, and from
hence he had gone forth with his father to seek a new home in the
west. Their first resting-place had been Harran in Mesopotamia, on
the high-road to Syria and the Mediterranean. The name of Harran,
in fact, signified "road" in the old language of Chald&aelig;a, and
for many ages the armies and merchants of Babylonia had halted
there when making their way towards the Mediterranean. Like Ur, it
was dedicated to the worship of Sin, the Moon-god, and its temple
rivalled in fame and antiquity that of the Babylonian city, and had
probably been founded by a Babylonian king.</p>
<p>At Harran, therefore, Abraham would still have been within the
limits of Babylonian influence and <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page167" id="page167"></a>{167}</span> culture, if not of
Babylonian government as well. He would have found there the same
religion as that which he had left behind him in his native city;
the same deity was adored there, under the same name and with the
same rites. He was indeed on the road to Canaan, and among an
Aramaean rather than a Babylonian population, but Babylonia with
its beliefs and civilization had not as yet been forsaken. Even the
language of Babylonia was known in his new home, as is indicated by
the name of the city itself.</p>
<p>Harran and Mesopotamia were not the goal of the future father of
the Israelitish people. He was bidden to seek elsewhere another
country and another kindred. Canaan was the land which God promised
to "show" to him, and it was in Canaan that his descendants were to
become "a great nation." He went forth, accordingly, "to go into
the land of Canaan, and into the land of Canaan he came."</p>
<p>But even in Canaan Abraham was not beyond the reach of
Babylonian influence. As we have seen in the last chapter,
Babylonian armies had already penetrated to the shores of the
Mediterranean, Palestine had been included within the bounds of a
Babylonian empire, and Babylonian culture and religion had spread
widely among the Canaanitish tribes. The cuneiform system of
writing had made its way to Syria, and Babylonian literature had
followed in its wake. Centuries had already passed since Sargon of
Akkad had made <span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id=
"page168"></a>{168}</span> himself master of the Mediterranean
coast and his son Naram-Sin had led his forces to the Peninsula of
Sinai. Istar of Babylonia had become Ashtoreth of the Canaanites,
and Babylonian trade had long moved briskly along the very road
that Abraham traversed. In the days of the patriarch himself the
rulers of Babylonia claimed to be also rulers of Canaan; for
thirteen years did the Canaanite princes "serve" Chedor-laomer and
his allies, the father of Arioch is also "the father of the land of
the Amorites" in his son's inscriptions, and at a little later date
the King of Babylon still claimed sovereignty over the West.</p>
<p>It was not, therefore, to a strange and unexplored country that
Abraham had migrated. The laws and manners to which he had been
accustomed, the writing and literature which he had learned in the
schools of Ur, the religious beliefs among which he had lived in
Chald&aelig;a and Harran, he found again in Canaan. The land of his
adoption was full of Babylonian traders, soldiers, and probably
officials as well, and from time to time he must have heard around
him the language of his birthplace. The introduction into the West
of the Babylonian literature and script brought with it a knowledge
of the Babylonian language, and the knowledge is reflected in some
of the local names of Palestine. The patriarch had not escaped
beyond the control even of the Babylonian government. At times, at
all events, the princes of Canaan were compelled to acknowledge the
suzerainty of Chald&aelig;a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page169"
id="page169"></a>{169}</span> and obey the laws, as the Babylonians
would have said, of "Anu and Dagon."</p>
<p>The fact needs dwelling upon, partly because of its importance,
partly because it is but recently that we have begun to realize it.
It might indeed have been gathered from the narratives of Genesis,
more especially from the account of Chedor-laomer's campaign, but
it ran counter to the preconceived ideas of the modern historian,
and never therefore took definite shape in his mind. It is one of
the many gains that the decipherment of the cuneiform inscriptions
has brought to the student of the Old Testament, and it makes us
understand the story of Abraham's migration in a way that was never
possible before. He was no wild nomad wandering in unknown regions,
among a people of alien habits and foreign civilization. We know
now why he took the road which we are told he followed; why he was
able to make allies among the inhabitants of Canaan; why he
understood their language and could take part in their social life.
Like the Englishman who migrates to a British colony, Abraham was
in contact with the same culture in Canaan and Chald&aelig;a
alike.</p>
<p>But when he reached Canaan he was not yet Abraham. He was still
"Abram the Hebrew," and it was as "Abram the Hebrew" that he made
alliance with the Amorites of Mamre and overthrew the retreating
forces of the Babylonian kings. Abram&mdash;Abu-ramu, "the exalted
father,"&mdash;is a Babylonian name, and is found in contracts of
the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id=
"page170"></a>{170}</span> age of Chedor-laomer. When the name was
changed to Abraham, it was a sign that the Babylonian emigrant had
become a native of the West.</p>
<p>It was under the terebinth of Moreh before Shechem that Abraham
first pitched his tent and erected his first altar to the Lord.
Above him towered Ebal and Gerizim, where the curses and blessings
of the Law were afterwards to be pronounced. From thence he moved
southward to one of the hills westward of Beth-el, the modern
Beitin, and there his second altar was built. While the first had
been reared in the plain, the second was raised on the
mountain-slope.</p>
<p>But here too he did not remain long. Again he "journeyed, going
on still towards the south." Then came a famine which obliged him
to cross the frontier of Egypt, and visit the court of the Pharaoh.
The Hyksos kinsmen of the race to which he belonged were ruling in
the Delta, and a ready welcome was given to the Asiatic stranger.
He was "very rich in cattle, in silver and in gold," and like a
wealthy Arab sheikh to-day was received with due honour in the
Egyptian capital. The court of the Pharaoh was doubtless at
Zoan.</p>
<p>Among the possessions of the patriarch we are told were camels.
The camel is not included among the Egyptian hieroglyphs, nor has
it been found depicted on the walls of the Egyptian temples and
tombs. The name is first met with in a papyrus of the time of the
nineteenth dynasty, and is one of the many words which the
Egyptians <span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id=
"page171"></a>{171}</span> of that age borrowed from their
Canaanitish neighbours. The animal, in fact, was not used by the
Egyptians, and its domestication in the valley of the Nile seems to
be as recent as the Arab conquest. But though it was not used by
the Egyptians, it had been a beast of burden among the Semites of
Arabia from an early period. In the primitive Sumerian language of
Chald&aelig;a it was called "the animal from the Persian Gulf," and
its Semitic name, from which our own word <i>camel</i> is derived,
goes back to the very beginnings of Semitic history. We cannot,
therefore, imagine a Semitic nomad arriving in Egypt without the
camel; travellers, indeed, from the cities of Canaan might do so,
but not those who led a purely nomadic life. And, in fact, though
we look in vain for a picture of the camel among the sculptures and
paintings of Egypt, the bones of the animal have been discovered
deep in the alluvial soil of the valley of the Nile.</p>
<p>Abraham had to quit Egypt, and once more he traversed the desert
of the "South" and pitched his tent near Beth-el. Here his nephew
Lot left him, and, dissatisfied with the life of a wandering
Bedawi, took up his abode in the city of Sodom at the northern end
of the Dead Sea. While Abraham kept himself separate from the
natives of Canaan, Lot thus became one of them, and narrowly
escaped the doom which afterwards fell upon the cities of the
plain. In forsaking the tent, he forsook not only the free life of
the immigrant from Chald&aelig;a, but the God of Abraham as well.
The inhabitant <span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id=
"page172"></a>{172}</span> of a Canaanitish city passed under the
influence of its faith and worship, its morals and manners, as well
as its laws and government. He ceased to be an alien and stranger,
of a different race and fatherland, and with a religion and customs
of his own. He could intermarry with the natives of his adopted
country and participate in their sacred rites. Little by little his
family became merged in the population that surrounded him; its
gods became their gods, its morality&mdash;or, it may be, its
immorality&mdash;became theirs also. Lot, indeed, had eventually to
fly from Sodom, leaving behind him all his wealth; but the mischief
had already been done, and his children had become Canaanites in
thought and deed. The nations which sprang from him, though
separate in race from the older people of Canaan, were yet like
them in other respects. They formed no "peculiar people," to whom
the Lord might reveal Himself through the law and the prophets.</p>
<p>It was not until Lot had separated himself from Abraham that the
land of Canaan was promised to the descendants of the patriarch.
"Lift up now thine eyes," God said to him, "and look from the place
where thou art, northward and southward, and eastward and westward:
for all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to
thy seed for ever." Once more, therefore, Abraham departed
southward from Shechem; not this time to go into the land of Egypt,
but to dwell beside the terebinth-oak of Mamre hard by Hebron,
where the founder of the Davidic monarchy was hereafter to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id=
"page173"></a>{173}</span> crowned king. It is probable that the
sanctuary which in days to come was to make Hebron famous had not
as yet been established there; at all events the name of Hebron,
"the confederacy," was not as yet known, and the city was called
Kirjath-Arba. Whether it was also called Mamre is doubtful; Mamre
would rather seem to have been the name of the plateau which
stretched beyond the valley of Hebron and was occupied by the
Amorite confederates of the Hebrew patriarch.</p>
<p>It was while he "dwelt under the terebinth of Mamre the Amorite"
that the campaign of Chedor-laomer and his Babylonian allies took
place, and that Lot was carried away among the Canaanitish
captives. But the triumph of the conquerors was short-lived. "Abram
the Hebrew" pursued them with his armed followers, three hundred
and eighteen in number, as well as with his Amorite allies, and
suddenly falling upon their rear-guard near Damascus by night,
rescued the captives and the spoil. There was rejoicing in the
Canaanitish cities when the patriarch returned with his booty. The
new king of Sodom met him in the valley of Shaveh, "the king's
dale" of later times, just outside the walls of Jerusalem, and the
king of Jerusalem himself, Melchizedek, "the priest of the most
High God," welcomed the return of the victor with bread and wine.
Then it was that Abram gave tithes of the spoil to the God of
Salem, while Melchizedek blessed him in the name of "the most High
God."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id=
"page174"></a>{174}</span>
<p>Outside the pages of the Old Testament the special form assumed
by the blessing has been found only in the Aramaic inscriptions of
Egypt. Here too we find travellers from Palestine writing of
themselves "Blessed be Augah of Isis," or "Blessed be Abed-Nebo of
Khnum"! It would seem, therefore, to have been a formula peculiar
to Canaan; at all events, it has not been traced to other parts of
the Semitic world. The temple of the Most High God&mdash;El
Ely&ocirc;n&mdash;probably stood on Mount Moriah where the temple
of the God of Israel was afterwards to be erected. It will be
remembered that among the letters sent by Ebed-Tob, the king of
Jerusalem, to the Egyptian Pharaoh is one in which he speaks of
"the city of the Mountain of Jerusalem, whose name is the city of
the temple of the god Nin-ip." In this "Mountain of Jerusalem" it
is difficult not to see the "temple-Mount" of later days.</p>
<p>In the cuneiform texts of Ebed-Tob and the later Assyrian kings
the name of Jerusalem is written Uru-Salim, "the city of Salim."
Salim or "Peace" is almost certainly the native name of the god who
was identified with the Babylonian Nin-ip, and perhaps
Isaiah&mdash;that student of the older history of his
country&mdash;is alluding to the fact when he declares that one of
the titles of the Messiah shall be "the Prince of Peace." At any
rate, if the Most High God of Jerusalem were really Salim, the God
of Peace, we should have an explanation of the blessing pronounced
by Melchizedek upon the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id=
"page175"></a>{175}</span> patriarch. Abram's victory had restored
peace to Canaan; he had brought back the captives, and had himself
returned in peace. It was fitting, therefore, that he should be
welcomed by the priest of the God of Peace, and that he should
offer tithes of the booty he had recovered to the god of "the City
of Peace."</p>
<p>This offering of tithes was no new thing. In his Babylonian home
Abraham must have been familiar with the practice. The cuneiform
inscriptions of Babylonia contain frequent references to it. It
went back to the pre-Semitic age of Chald&aelig;a, and the great
temples of Babylonia were largely supported by the <i>esra</i> or
tithe which was levied upon prince and peasant alike. That the god
should receive a tenth of the good things which, it was believed,
he had bestowed upon mankind, was not considered to be asking too
much. There are many tablets in the British Museum which are
receipts for the payment of the tithe to the great temple of the
Sun-god at Sippara in the time of Nebuchadrezzar and his
successors. From one of them we learn that Belshazzar, even at the
very moment when the Babylonian empire was falling from his
father's hands, nevertheless found an opportunity for paying the
tithe due from his sister; while others show us that Cyrus and
Cambyses did not regard their foreign origin as affording any
pretext for refusing to pay tithe to the gods of the kingdom they
had overthrown.</p>
<p>The Babylonian army had been defeated near <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>{176}</span> Damascus,
and immediately after this we are told that the steward of
Abraham's house was "Eli-ezer of Damascus." Whether there is any
connection between the two facts we cannot say; but it may be that
Eli-ezer had attached himself to the Hebrew conqueror when he was
returning "from the slaughter of Chedor-laomer." The name of
Eli-ezer, "God is a help," is characteristic of Damascus. More
often in place of El, "God," we have Hadad, the supreme deity of
Syria; but just as among the Israelites Eli-akim and Jeho-iakim are
equivalent, so among the Aramaeans of Syria were Eli-ezer and
Hadad-ezer. Hadad-ezer, it will be remembered, was the king of
Zobah who was overthrown by David.</p>
<p>Sarai, the wife of Abraham, was still childless, but the
patriarch had a son by his Egyptian handmaid, the ancestor of the
Ishmaelite tribes who spread from the frontier of Egypt to Mecca in
Central Arabia. It was when Ishmael was thirteen years of age that
the covenant was made between God and Abraham which was sealed with
the institution of circumcision. Circumcision had been practised in
Egypt from the earliest days of its history; henceforth it also
distinguished all those who claimed Abraham as their forefather.
With circumcision Abraham received the name by which he was
henceforth to be known; he ceased to be Abram, the Hebrew from
Babylonia, and became Abraham the father of Ishmael and Israel. The
new rite and the new name were alike the seal and <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>{177}</span> token of
the covenant established between the patriarch and his God: God
promised that his seed should multiply, and that the land of Canaan
should be given as an everlasting possession, while Abraham and his
offspring were called upon to keep God's covenant for ever.</p>
<p>It could not have been long after this that the cities of the
plain were destroyed "with brimstone and fire from the Lord out of
heaven." The expression is found in the cuneiform tablets of
Babylonia. Old Sumerian hymns spoke of a "rain of stones and fire,"
though the stones may have been hail-stones and thunderbolts, and
the fire the flash of the lightning. But whatever may have been the
nature of the sheet of flame which enveloped the guilty cities of
the plain and set on fire the naphtha-springs that oozed out of it,
the remembrance of the catastrophe survived to distant ages. The
prophets of Israel and Judah still refer to the overthrow of Sodom
and its sister cities, and St. Jude points to them as "suffering
the vengeance of eternal fire." Some scholars have seen an allusion
to their overthrow in the tradition of the Phoenicians which
brought their ancestors into the coastlands of Canaan in
consequence of an earth-quake on the shores of "the Assyrian Lake."
But the lake is more probably to be looked for in the neighbourhood
of the Persian Gulf than in the valley of the Jordan.</p>
<p>The vale of Siddim, and "the cities of the plain," stood at the
northern end of the Dead Sea. Here <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page178" id="page178"></a>{178}</span> were the "slime-pits" from
which the naphtha was extracted, and which caused the defeat of the
Canaanitish princes by the Babylonian army. The legend which placed
the pillar of salt into which Lot's wife was changed at the
southern extremity of the Dead Sea was of late origin, probably not
earlier than the days when Herod built his fortress of Machaerus on
the impregnable cliffs of Moab, and the name of Gebel Usdum, given
by the modern Arabs to one of the mountain-summits to the south of
the sea proves nothing as to the site of the city of Sodom. Names
in the east are readily transferred from one locality to another,
and a mountain is not the same as a city in a plain.</p>
<p>There are two sufficient reasons why it is to the north rather
than to the south that we must look for the remains of the doomed
cities, among the numerous tumuli which rise above the rich and
fertile plain in the neighbourhood of Jericho, where the ancient
"slime-pits" can still be traced. Geology has taught us that
throughout the historical period the Dead Sea and the country
immediately to the south of it have undergone no change. What the
lake is to-day, it must have been in the days of Abraham. It has
neither grown nor shrunk in size, and the barren salt with which it
poisons the ground must have equally poisoned it then. No fertile
valley, like the vale of Siddim, could have existed in the south;
no prosperous Canaanitish cities could have grown up among the
desolate tracts of the southern wilderness. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>{179}</span> As we are
expressly told in the Book of Numbers (xiii. 29), the Canaanites
dwelt only "by the coast of Jordan," not in the desert far beyond
the reach of the fertilizing stream.</p>
<p>But there is another reason which excludes the southern site.
"When Abraham got up early in the morning," we are told, "he looked
towards Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain,
and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke
of a furnace." Such a sight was possible from the hills of Hebron;
if the country lay at the northern end of the Dead Sea, it would
have been impossible had it been south of it.</p>
<p>Moreover, the northern situation of the cities alone agrees with
the geography of Genesis. When the Babylonian invaders had turned
northwards after smiting the Amalekites of the desert south of the
Dead Sea, they did not fall in with the forces of the king of Sodom
and his allies until they had first passed "the Amorites that dwelt
in Hazezon-tamar." Hazezon-tamar, as we learn from the Second Book
of Chronicles (xx. 2), was the later En-gedi, "the Spring of the
Kid," and En-gedi lay on the western shore of the Dead Sea midway
between its northern and southern extremities.</p>
<p>In the warm, soft valley of the Jordan, accordingly, where a
sub-tropical vegetation springs luxuriantly out of the fertile
ground and the river plunges into the Dead Sea as into a tomb, the
nations of Ammon and Moab were born. It was a <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>{180}</span> fitting
spot, in close proximity as it was to the countries which
thereafter bore their names. From the mountain above Zoar, Lot
could look across to the blue hills of Moab and the distant plateau
of Ammon.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Abraham had quitted Mamre and again turned his steps
towards the south. This time it was at Gerar, between the sanctuary
of Kadesh-barnea and Shur the "wall" of Egypt that he sojourned.
Kadesh has been found again in our own days by the united efforts
of Dr. John Rowlands and Dr. Clay Trumbull in the shelter of a
block of mountains which rise to the south of the desert of
Beer-sheba. The spring of clear and abundant water which gushes
forth in their midst was the En-Mishpat&mdash;"the spring where
judgments were pronounced"&mdash;of early times, and is still
called 'Ain-Qad&icirc;s, "the spring of Kadesh." Gerar is the
modern Umm el-Jer&acirc;r, now desolate and barren, all that
remains of its past being a lofty mound of rubbish and a mass of
potsherds. It lies a few hours only to the south of Gaza.</p>
<p>Here Isaac was born and circumcised, and here Ishmael and Hagar
were cast forth into the wilderness and went to dwell in the desert
of Paran. The territory of Gerar extended to Beer-sheba, "the well
of the oath," where Abraham's servants digged a well, and
Abimelech, king of Gerar, confirmed his possession of it by an
oath. It may be that one of the two wells which still exist at Wadi
es-Seba', with the stones that line their <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>{181}</span> mouths
deeply indented by the ropes of the water-drawers, is the very one
around which the herdsmen of Abraham and Abimelech wrangled with
each other. The wells of the desert go back to a great antiquity:
where water is scarce its discovery is not easily forgotten, and
the Beduin come with their flocks year after year to drink of it.
The old wells are constantly renewed, or new ones dug by their
side.</p>
<p>Gerar was in that south-western corner of Palestine which in the
age of the Exodus was inhabited by the Philistines. But they had
been new-comers. All through the period of the eighteenth and
nineteenth Egyptian dynasties the country had been in the hands of
the Egyptians. Gaza had been their frontier fortress, and as late
as the reign of Meneptah, the son of the Pharaoh of the Oppression,
it was still garrisoned by Egyptian troops and governed by Egyptian
officers. The Pulsata or Philistines did not arrive till the
troublous days of Ramses III., of the twentieth dynasty. They
formed part of the barbarian hordes from the shores of Asia Minor
and the islands of the &AElig;gean, who swarmed over Syria and
flung themselves on the valley of the Nile, and the land of Caphtor
from which they came was possibly the island of Krete. The
Philistine occupation of the coastland of Canaan, therefore, did
not long precede the Israelitish invasion of the Promised Land;
indeed we may perhaps gather from the words of Exod. xiii. 17 that
the Philistines were already winning <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page182" id="page182"></a>{182}</span> for themselves their new
territory when the Israelites marched out of Egypt. In saying,
consequently, that the kingdom of Abimelech was in the land of the
Philistines the Book of Genesis speaks proleptically: when the
story of Abraham and Abimelech was written in its present form
Gerar was a Philistine town: in the days of the patriarchs this was
not yet the case.</p>
<p>At Beer-sheba Abraham planted a tamarisk, and "called on the
name of the Lord, the everlasting God." Beer-sheba long remained
one of the sacred places of Palestine. The tree planted by its well
was a sign both of the water that flowed beneath its soil and of
its sacred character. It was only where fresh water was found that
the nomads of the desert could come together, and the tree was a
token of the life and refreshment they would meet with. The well
was sacred; so also was the solitary tree which stood beside it,
and under whose branches man and beast could find shade and
protection from the mid-day heat. Even Mohammedanism, that
Puritanism of the East, has not been able to eradicate the belief
in the divine nature of such trees from the mind of the nomad; we
may still see them decorated with offerings of rags torn from the
garments of the passer-by or shading the tomb of some reputed
saint. They are still more than waymarks or resting-places for the
heated and weary; when standing beneath them the herdsman feels
that he is walking upon consecrated ground.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id=
"page183"></a>{183}</span>
<p>It was at Beer-sheba that the temptation came to Abraham to
sacrifice his first-born, his only son Isaac. The temptation was in
accordance with the fierce ritual of Syria, and traces of the
belief which had called it into existence are to be found in the
early literature of Babylonia. Thus in an ancient Babylonian
ritual-text we read: "The offspring who raises his head among
mankind, the offspring for his life he gave; the head of the
offspring for the head of the man he gave; the neck of the
offspring for the neck of the man he gave." Phoenician legend told
how the god El had robed himself in royal purple and sacrificed his
only son Yeud in a time of pestilence, and the writers of Greece
and Rome describe with horror the sacrifices of the first-born with
which the history of Carthage was stained. The father was called
upon in time of trouble to yield up to the god his nearest and
dearest; the fruit of his body could alone wipe away the sin of his
soul, and Baal required him to sacrifice without a murmur or a tear
his first-born and his only one. The more precious the offering,
the more acceptable was it to the god; the harder the struggle to
resign it, the greater was the merit of doing so. The child died
for the sins of his people; and the belief was but the blind and
ignorant expression of a true instinct.</p>
<p>But Abraham was to be taught a better way. For three days he
journeyed northward with his son, and then lifting up his eyes saw
afar off that <span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id=
"page184"></a>{184}</span> mountain "in the land of Moriah," on the
summit of which the sacrifice was to be consummated. Alone with
Isaac he ascended to the high-place, and there building his altar
and binding to it his son he prepared to perform the terrible rite.
But at the last moment his hand was stayed, a new and better
revelation was made to him, and a ram was substituted for his son.
It cannot be accidental that, as M. Clermont-Ganneau has pointed
out, we learn from the temple-tariffs of Carthage and Marseilles
that in the later ritual of Phoenicia a ram took the place of the
earlier human sacrifice.</p>
<p>Where was this mountain in the land of Moriah whereon the altar
of Abraham was built? It would seem from a passage in the Second
Book of Chronicles (iii. 1) that it was the future temple-mount at
Jerusalem. The words of Genesis also point in the same direction.
Abraham, we read, "called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as
it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen."
It is hard to believe that "the mount of the Lord" can mean
anything else than that <i>har-el</i> or "mountain of God" whereon
Ezekiel places the temple, or that the proverb can refer to a less
holy spot than that where the Lord appeared enthroned upon the
cherubim above the mercy-seat. It is doubtful, however, whether the
reading of the Hebrew text in either passage is correct. According
to the Septuagint the proverb quoted in Genesis should run: "In the
mountain is the Lord seen," and the same authority changes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id=
"page185"></a>{185}</span> the "Moriah" of the Book of Chronicles
into <i>Am&ocirc;r-eia</i>, "of the Amorites."</p>
<p>It is true that the distance of Jerusalem from Beer-sheba would
agree well with the three days' journey of Abraham. But it is
difficult to reconcile the description of the scene of Abraham's
sacrifice with the future temple-mount. Where Isaac was bound to
the altar was a solitary spot, the patriarch and his son were alone
there, and it was overgrown with brushwood so thickly that a ram
had been caught in it by his horns. The temple-mount, on the
contrary, was either within the walls of a city or just outside
them, and the city was already a capital famous for its worship of
"the most High God." Had the Moriah of Jerusalem really been the
site of Abraham's altar it is strange that no allusion is made to
the fact by the writers of the Old Testament, or that tradition
should have been silent on the matter. We must be content with the
knowledge that it was to one of the mountains "in the land of
Moriah" that Abraham was led, and that "Moriah" was a "land," not a
single mountain-peak. (We should not forget that the Septuagint
reads "the highlands," that is, <i>Moreh</i> instead of
<i>Moriah</i>, while the Syriac version boldly changes the word
into the name of the "Amorites." For arguments on the other side,
see p. <a href="#page79">79</a>.)</p>
<p>Abraham returned to Beer-sheba, and from thence went to Hebron,
where Sarah died. Hebron&mdash;or Kirjath-Arba as it was then
called&mdash;was occupied by a Hittite tribe, in contradistinction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id=
"page186"></a>{186}</span> to the country round about it, which was
in the possession of the Amorites. As at Jerusalem, or at Kadesh on
the Orontes, the Hittites had intruded into Amoritish territory and
established themselves in the fortress-town. But while the Hittite
city was known as Kirjath-Arba, "the city of Arba," the Amoritish
district was named Mamre: the union of Kirjath-Arba and Mamre
created the Hebron of a later day.</p>
<p>Kirjath-Arba seems to have been built in the valley, close to
the pools which still provide water for its modern inhabitants. On
the eastern side the slope of the hill is honeycombed with tombs
cut in the rock, and, if ancient tradition is to be believed, it
was in one of these that Abraham desired to lay the body of his
wife. The "double cave" of Machpelah&mdash;for so the Septuagint
renders the phrase&mdash;was in the field of Ephron the Hittite,
and from Ephron, accordingly, the Hebrew patriarch purchased the
land for 400 shekels of silver, or about &pound;47. The cave, we
are told, lay opposite Mamre, which goes to show that the oak under
which Abraham once pitched his tent may not have been very far
distant from that still pointed out as the oak of Mamre in the
grounds of the Russian hospice. The traditional tomb of Machpelah
has been venerated alike by Jew, Christian, and Mohammedan. The
church built over it in Byzantine days and restored by the
Crusaders to Christian worship has been transformed into a mosque,
but its sanctity has remained unchanged. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>{187}</span> It stands
in the middle of a court, enclosed by a solid wall of massive
stones, the lower courses of which were cut and laid in their
places in the age of Herod. The fanatical Moslem is unwilling that
any but himself should enter the sacred precincts, but by climbing
the cliff behind the town it is possible to look down upon the
mosque and its sacred enclosure, and see the whole building spread
out like a map below the feet.</p>
<p>More than one English traveller has been permitted to enter the
mosque, and we are now well acquainted with the details of its
architecture. But the rock-cut tomb in which the bodies of the
patriarchs are supposed to have lain has never been examined by the
explorer. It is probable, however, that were he to penetrate into
it he would find nothing to reward his pains. During the long
period that Hebron was in Christian hands the cave was more than
once visited by the pilgrim. But we look in vain in the records
which have come down to us for an account of the relics it has been
supposed to contain. Had the mummified corpses of the patriarchs
been preserved in it, the fact would have been known to the
travellers of the Crusading age. (See the <i>Zeitschrift des
deutschen Pal&auml;stina-Vereins</i>, 1895.)</p>
<p>Like the other tombs in its neighbourhood, the cave of Machpelah
has doubtless been opened and despoiled at an early epoch. We know
that tombs were violated in Egypt long before the days of Abraham,
in spite of the penalties with which such <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>{188}</span> acts of
sacrilege were visited, and the cupidity of the Canaanite was no
less great than that of the Egyptian. The treasures buried with the
dead were too potent an attraction, and the robber of the tomb
braved for their sake the terrors of both this world and the
next.</p>
<p>Abraham now sent his servant to Mesopotamia, to seek there for a
wife for his son Isaac from among his kinsfolk at Harran. Rebekah,
the sister of Laban, accordingly, was brought to Canaan and wedded
to her cousin. Isaac was at the time in the southern desert,
encamped at the well of Lahai-roi, near Kadesh. So "Isaac was
comforted after his mother's death."</p>
<p>"Then again," we are told, "Abraham took a wife," whose name was
Keturah, and by whom he was the forefather of a number of Arabian
tribes. They occupied the northern and central parts of the Arabian
peninsula, by the side of the Ishmaelites, and colonized the land
of Midian. It is the last we hear of the great patriarch. He died
soon afterwards "in a good old age," and was buried at Machpelah
along with his wife.</p>
<p>Isaac still dwell at Lahai-roi, and there the twins, Esau and
Jacob, were born to him. There, too, he still was when a famine
fell upon the land, like "the first famine that was in the days of
Abraham." The story of Abraham's dealings with Abimelech of Gerar
is repeated in the case of Isaac. Again we hear of Phichol, the
captain of Abimelech's army; again the wife of the patriarch is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id=
"page189"></a>{189}</span> described as his sister; and again his
herdsmen strive with those of the king of Gerar over the wells they
have dug, and the well of Beer-sheba is made to derive its name
from the oaths sworn mutually by Isaac and the king. It is hardly
conceivable that history could have so closely repeated itself,
that the lives of the king and commander-in-chief of Gerar could
have extended over so many years, or that the origin of the name of
Beer-sheba would have been so quickly forgotten. Rather we must
believe that two narratives have been mingled together, and that
the earlier visit of Abraham to Gerar has coloured the story of
Isaac's sojourn in the territory of Abimelech. We need not refuse
to believe that the servants of Isaac dug wells and wrangled over
them with the native herdsmen; that Beer-sheba should twice have
received its name from a repetition of the same event is a
different matter. One of the wells&mdash;that of
Rehoboth&mdash;made by Isaac's servants is probably referred to in
the Egyptian <i>Travels of a Mohar</i>, where it is called
Rehoburta.</p>
<p>Isaac was not a wanderer like his father. Lahai-roi in the
desert, "the valley of Gerar," Beer-sheba and Hebron, were the
places round which his life revolved, and they were all close to
one another. There is no trace of his presence in the north of
Palestine, and when the prophet Amos (vii. 16) makes Isaac
synonymous with the northern kingdom of Israel, there can be no
geographical reference in his words. Isaac died <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>{190}</span>
eventually at Hebron, and was buried in the family tomb of
Machpelah.</p>
<p>But long before this happened Jacob had fled from the
well-deserved wrath of his brother to his uncle Laban at Harran. On
his way he had slept on the rocky ridge of Bethel, and had beheld
in vision the angels of God ascending and descending the steps of a
staircase that led to heaven. The nature of the ground itself must
have suggested the dream. The limestone rock is fissured into
steplike terraces, which seem formed of blocks of stone piled one
upon the other, and rising upwards like a gigantic staircase
towards the sky. On the hill that towers above the ruins of
Beth-el, we may still fancy that we see before us the "ladder" of
Jacob.</p>
<p>But the vision was more than a mere dream. God appeared in it to
the patriarch, and repeated to him the promise that had been made
to his fathers. Through Jacob, the younger of the twins, the true
line of Abraham was to be carried on. When he awoke in the morning
the fugitive recognized the real character of his dream. He took,
accordingly, the stone that had served him for a pillow, and
setting it up as an altar, poured oil upon it, and so made it a
Beth-el, or "House of God," Henceforward it was a consecrated
altar, a holy memorial of the God whose divinity had been
mysteriously imparted to it.</p>
<p>The Semitic world was full of such Beth-els, or consecrated
stones. They are referred to in the literature of ancient
Babylonia, and an English <span class="pagenum"><a name="page191"
id="page191"></a>{191}</span> traveller, Mr. Doughty, has found
them still existing near the Tema of the Old Testament in Northern
Arabia. In Phoenicia we are told that they abounded. The solitary
rock in the desert or on the mountain-side seemed to the primitive
Semite the dwelling-place of Deity; it rose up awe-striking and
impressive in its solitary grandeur and venerable antiquity; it was
a shelter to him from the heat of the sun, and a protection from
the perils of the night. When his worship and adoration came in
time to be transferred from the stone itself to the divinity it had
begun to symbolize, it became an altar on which the libation of oil
or wine might be poured out to the gods, and on the seals of Syria
and the sculptured slabs of Assyria we accordingly find it
transformed into a portable altar, and merged in the cone-like
symbol of the goddess Ash&ecirc;rah. The stone which had itself
been a Beth-el wherein the Deity had his home, passed by degrees
into the altar of the god whose actual dwelling-place was in
heaven.</p>
<p>The Canaanitish city near which Jacob had raised the monument of
his dream bore the name of Luz. In Israelitish days, however, the
name of the monument was transferred to that of the city, and Luz
itself was called the Beth-el, or "House of God." The god
worshipped there when the Israelites first entered Canaan appears
to have been entitled On,&mdash;a name derived, perhaps, from that
of the city of the Sun-god in Egypt. Bethel was also Beth-On, "the
temple of On," from whence the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page192" id="page192"></a>{192}</span> tribe of Benjamin
afterwards took the name of Ben-Oni, "the Onite." Beth-On has
survived into our own times, and the site of the old city is still
known as Beit&icirc;n.</p>
<p>It is not needful to follow the adventures of Jacob in
Mesopotamia. His new home lay far away from the boundaries of
Palestine, and though the kings of Aram-Naharaim made raids at
times into the land of Canaan and caused their arms to be feared
within the walls of Jerusalem, they never made any permanent
conquests on the coasts of the Mediterranean. In the land of the
Aramaeans Jacob is lost for awhile from the history of patriarchal
Palestine.</p>
<p>When he again emerges, it is as a middle-aged man, rich in
flocks and herds, who has won two wives as the reward of his
labours, and is already the father of a family. He is on his way
back to the country which had been promised to his seed and wherein
he himself had been born. Laban, his father-in-law, robbed at once
of his daughters and his household gods, is pursuing him, and has
overtaken him on the spurs of Mount Gilead, almost within sight of
his goal. There a covenant is made between the Aramaean and the
Hebrew, and a cairn of stones is piled up to commemorate the fact.
The cairn continued to bear a double name, the Aramaean name given
to it by Laban, and the Canaanitish name of Galeed, "the heap of
witnesses," by which it was called by Jacob. The double name was a
sign of the two populations <span class="pagenum"><a name="page193"
id="page193"></a>{193}</span> and languages which the cairn
separated from one another. Northward were the Aramaeans and an
Aramaic speech; southward the land of Canaan and the language which
we term Hebrew.</p>
<p>The spot where the cairn was erected bore yet another title. It
was also called Mizpah, the "watch-tower," the outpost from which
the dweller in Canaan could discern the approaching bands of an
enemy from the north or east. It protected the road to the Jordan,
and kept watch over the eastern plateau. Here in after times
Jephthah gathered around him the patriots of Israel, and delivered
his people from the yoke of the Ammonites.</p>
<p>Once more "Jacob went on his way," and from the "two-fold camp"
of Mahanaim sent messengers to his brother Esau, who had already
established himself among the mountains of Seir. Then came the
mysterious struggle in the silent darkness of night with one whom
the patriarch believed to have been his God Himself. When day
dawned, the vision departed from him, but not until his name had
been changed. "Thy name," it was declared to him, "shall be called
no more Jacob, but Israel; for as a prince hast thou power with God
and with men, and hast prevailed." And his thigh was shrunken, so
that the children of Israel in days to come abstained from eating
"of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh."
The spot where the struggle took place, beside the waters of the
Jabbok, was named Penu-el, "the face of God." There was more than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id=
"page194"></a>{194}</span> one other Penu-el in the Semitic world,
and at Carthage the goddess Tanith was entitled Peni-Baal, "the
face of Baal."</p>
<p>The name of Israel, as we may learn from its equivalent,
Jeshurun, was really derived from a root which signified "to be
straight," or "upright." The Israelites were in truth "the people
of uprightness." It is only by one of those plays upon words, of
which the Oriental is still so fond, that the name can be brought
into connection with the word <i>sar</i>, "a prince." But the name
of Jacob was well known among the northern Semites. We gather from
the inscriptions of Egypt that its full form was Jacob-el. Like
Jeshurun by the side of Israel, or Jephthah by the side of
Jiphthah-el (Josh. xix. 27), Jacob is but an abbreviated Jacob-el.
One of the places in Palestine conquered by the Pharaoh Thothmes
III., the names of which are recorded on the walls of his temple at
Karnak, was Jacob-el&mdash;a reminiscence, doubtless, of the Hebrew
patriarch. Professor Flinders Petrie has made us acquainted with
Egyptian scarabs on which is inscribed in hieroglyphic characters
the name of a king, Jacob-bar or Jacob-hal, who reigned in the
valley of the Nile before Abraham entered it, and Mr. Pinches has
lately discovered the name of Jacob-el among the persons mentioned
in contracts of the time of the Babylonian sovereign
Sin-mu-ballidh, who was a contemporary of Chedor-laomer. We thus
have monumental evidence that the name of Jacob was well known
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id=
"page195"></a>{195}</span> in the Semitic world in the age of the
Hebrew patriarchs.</p>
<p>Jacob and Esau met and were reconciled, and Jacob then journeyed
onwards to Succoth, "the booths." The site of this village of
"booths" is unknown, but it could not have been far from the banks
of the Jordan and the road to Nabl&ucirc;s. The neighbourhood of
Shechem, called in Greek times Neapolis, the Nabl&ucirc;s of
to-day, was the next resting-place of the patriarch. If we are to
follow the translation of the Authorised Version, it would have
been at "Shalem, a city of Shechem," that his tents were pitched.
But many eminent scholars believe that the Hebrew words should
rather be rendered: "And Jacob came in peace to the city of
Shechem," the reference being to his peaceable parting from his
brother. There is, however, a hamlet still called Sal&icirc;m,
nearly three miles to the east of Nabl&ucirc;s, and it may be
therefore that it was really at a place termed Shalem that Jacob
rested on his way. In this case the field bought from Hamor,
"before the city of Shechem," cannot have been where, since the
days of our Lord, "Jacob's well" has been pointed out (S. John iv.
5, 6). The well is situated considerably westward of Sal&icirc;m,
midway, in fact, between that village and Nabl&ucirc;s, and close
to the village of 'Ask&acirc;r, with which the "Sychar" of S.
John's Gospel has sometimes been identified. It has been cut
through the solid rock to a depth of more than a hundred feet, and
the groovings made by the ropes of the waterpots <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>{196}</span> in
far-off centuries are still visible at its mouth. But no water can
be drawn from it now. The well is choked with the rubbish of a
ruined church, built above it in the early days of Christianity,
and of which all that remains is a broken arch. It has been dug at
a spot where the road from Shechem to the Jordan branches off from
that which runs towards the north, though Shechem itself is more
than a mile distant. We should notice that S. John does not say
that the well was actually in "the parcel of ground that Jacob gave
to his son Joseph," only that it was "near to" the patriarch's
field.</p>
<p>If Jacob came to Shechem in peace, the peace was of no long
continuance. Simeon and Levi, the sons of the patriarch, avenged
the insult offered by the Shechemite prince to their sister Dinah,
by treacherously falling upon the city and slaying "all the males."
Jacob was forced to fly, leaving behind him the altar he had
erected. He made for the Canaanitish city of Luz, the Beth-el of
later days, where he had seen the great altar-stairs sloping upward
to heaven. The idols that had been carried from Mesopotamia were
buried "under the oak which was by Shechem," along with the
ear-rings of the women. The oak was one of those sacred trees which
abounded in the Semitic world, like another oak at Beth-el, beneath
which the nurse of Rebekah was soon afterwards to be buried.</p>
<p>At Beth-el Jacob built another altar. But he <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>{197}</span> could not
rest there, and once more took his way to the south. On the road
his wife Rachel died while giving birth to his youngest son, and
her tomb beside the path to Beth-lehem was marked by a "pillar"
which the writer of the Book of Genesis tells us remained to his
own day. It indicated the boundary between the territories of
Benjamin and Judah at Zelzah (1 Sam. x. 2).</p>
<p>At Beth-lehem Jacob lingered a long while. His flocks and herds
were spread over the country, under the charge of his sons,
browsing on the hills and watered at the springs, for which the
"hill-country of Judah" was famous. In their search for pasturage
they wandered northward, we are told, "beyond the tower of the
Flock," which guarded the Jebusite stronghold of Zion (Mic. iv. 8).
Beth-lehem itself was more commonly known in that age by the name
of Ephrath. Beth-lehem, "the temple of Lehem," must, in fact, have
been the sacred name of the city derived from the worship of its
chief deity, and Mr. Tomkins is doubtless right in seeing in this
deity the Babylonian Lakhmu, who with his consort Lakhama, was
regarded as a primaeval god of the nascent world.</p>
<p>At Beth-lehem Jacob was but a few miles distant from Hebron,
where Isaac still lived, and where at his death he was buried by
his sons Jacob and Esau in the family tomb of Machpelah. It was the
last time, seemingly, that the two brothers found themselves
together. Esau, partly <span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id=
"page198"></a>{198}</span> by marriage, partly by conquest,
dispossessed the Horites of Mount Seir, and founded the kingdom of
Edom, while the sons and flocks of Jacob scattered themselves from
Hebron in the south of Canaan to Shechem in its centre. The two
hallowed sanctuaries of the future kingdoms of Judah and Israel,
where the first throne was set up in Israel and the monarchy of
David was first established, thus became the boundaries of the
herdsmen's domain. In both the Hebrew patriarch held ground that
was rightfully his own. It was a sign that the house of Israel
should hereafter occupy the land which the family of Israel thus
roamed over with their flocks. The nomad was already passing into
the settler, with fields and burial-places of his own.</p>
<p>But before the transformation could be fully accomplished, a
long season of growth and preparation was needful. Egypt, and not
Canaan, was to be the land in which the Chosen People should be
trained for their future work. Canaan itself was to pass under
Egyptian domination, and to replace the influence of Babylonian
culture by that of Egypt. It was a new world and a new civilization
into which the descendants of Jacob were destined to emerge when
finally they escaped from the fiery furnace of Egyptian bondage.
The Egypt known to Jacob was an Egypt over which Asiatic princes
ruled, and whose vizier was himself a Hebrew. It was the Egypt of
the Hyksos conquerors, whose capital was Zoan, on the frontiers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id=
"page199"></a>{199}</span> of Asia, and whose people were the
slaves of an Asiatic stranger. The Egypt quitted by his descendants
was one which had subjected Asia to itself, and had carried the
spoils of Syria to its splendid capital in the far south. The
Asiatic wave had been rolled back from the banks of the Nile, and
Egyptian conquest and culture had overflooded Asia as far as the
Euphrates.</p>
<p>But it was not Egypt alone which had undergone a change. The
Canaan of Abraham and Jacob looked to Babylonia for its
civilization, its literature, and its laws. Its princes recognized
at times the supremacy of the Babylonian sovereigns, and the
deities of Babylonia were worshipped in its midst. The Canaan of
Moses had long been a province of the Egyptian Empire; Egyptian
rule had been substituted for that of Babylon, and the manners and
customs of Egypt had penetrated deeply into the minds of its
inhabitants. The Hittite invasion from the north had blocked the
high-road to Babylonia, and diverted the trade of Palestine towards
the west and the south. While Abraham, the native of Ur, and the
emigrant from Harran, had found himself in Canaan, and even at
Zoan, still within the sphere of the influences among which he had
grown up, the fugitives from Egypt entered on the invasion of a
country which had but just been delivered from the yoke of the
Pharaohs. It was an Egyptian Canaan that the Israelites were called
upon to subdue, and it was fitting therefore that they should have
been made <span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id=
"page200"></a>{200}</span> ready for the task by their long sojourn
in the land of Goshen.</p>
<p>How that sojourn came about, it is not for us to recount. The
story of Joseph is too familiar to be repeated, though we are but
just beginning to learn how true it is, in all its details, to the
facts which Egyptian research is bringing more and more fully to
light. We see the Midianite and Ishmaelite caravan passing
Dothan&mdash;still known by its ancient name&mdash;with their bales
of spicery from Gilead for the dwellers in the Delta, and carrying
away with them the young Hebrew slave. We watch his rise in the
house of his Egyptian master, his wrongful imprisonment and sudden
exaltation when he sits by the side of Pharaoh and governs Egypt in
the name of the king. We read the pathetic story of the old father
sending his sons to buy corn from the royal granaries or
<i>larits</i> of Egypt, and withholding to the last his youngest
and dearest one; of the Beduin shepherds bowing all unconsciously
before the brother whom they had sold into slavery, and who now
holds in his hands the power of life and death; of Joseph's
disclosure of himself to the conscious-stricken suppliants; of
Jacob's cry when convinced at last that "the governor over all the
land of Egypt" was his long-mourned son. "It is enough; Joseph my
son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die."</p>
<p>Jacob and his family travelled in wagons along the high-road
which connected the south of Palestine <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>{201}</span> with the
Delta. It led past Beer-sheba and El-Ar&icirc;sh to the Shur, or
line of fortifications which protected the eastern frontier of
Egypt. The modern caravan road follows its course most of the way.
It was thus distinct from "the way of the Philistines," which led
along the coast of the Mediterranean, on the northern edge of the
Sirbonian Lake. In Egypt the Israelitish emigrants settled not far
from the Hyksos capital in the land of Goshen, which the
excavations of Dr. Naville have shown to be the W&acirc;di
Tumil&acirc;t of to-day. Here they multiplied and grew wealthy,
until the evil days came when the Egyptians rose up against Semitic
influence and control, and Ramses II. transformed the free-born
Beduin into public serfs.</p>
<p>But the age of Ramses II. was still far distant when Jacob died
full of years, and his mummy was carried to the burial-place of his
fathers "in the land of Canaan." Local tradition connected the name
of Abel-mizraim, "the meadow of Egypt," on the eastern side of the
Jordan, with the long funeral procession which wended its way from
Zoan to Hebron. We cannot believe, however, that the mourners would
have so far gone out of their road, even if the etymology assigned
by tradition to the name could be supported. The tradition bears
witness to the fact of the procession, but to nothing more.</p>
<p>With the funeral of Jacob a veil falls upon the Biblical history
of Canaan, until the days when the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page202" id="page202"></a>{202}</span> spies were sent out to
search the land. Joseph was buried in Egypt, not at Hebron, though
he had made the Israelites swear before his death that his mummy
should be eventually taken to Palestine. The road to Hebron, it is
clear, was no longer open, and the power of the Hyksos princes must
have been fast waning. The war of independence had broken out, and
the native kings of Upper Egypt were driving the foreigner back
into Asia. The rulers of Zoan had no longer troops to spare for a
funeral procession through the eastern desert.</p>
<p>The Chronicler, however, has preserved a notice which seems to
show that a connection was still kept up between Southern Canaan
and the Hebrew settlers in Goshen, even after Jacob's death,
perhaps while he was yet living. We are told that certain of the
sons of Ephraim were slain by the men of Gath, whose cattle they
had attempted to steal, and that their father, after mourning many
days, comforted himself with the birth of other sons (1 Chron. vii.
21-26). The notice, moreover, does not stand alone. Thothmes III.,
the great conqueror of the eighteenth Egyptian dynasty, states that
two of the places captured by him in Palestine were Jacob-el and
Joseph-el. It is tempting to see in the two names reminiscences of
the Hebrew patriarch and his son. If so, the name of Joseph would
have been impressed upon a locality in Canaan more than two
centuries before the Exodus. The geographical lists of Thothmes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id=
"page203"></a>{203}</span> III. and the fragments of early history
preserved by the Chronicler would thus support and complete one
another. The Egyptian cavalry who accompanied the mummy of Jacob to
its resting-place at Machpelah, would not be the only evidence of
the authority claimed by Joseph and his master in the land of
Canaan; Joseph himself would have left his name there, and his
grand-children would have fought against "the men of Gath."</p>
<p>But these are speculations which may, or may not, be confirmed
by archaeological discovery. For the Book of Genesis Canaan
disappears from sight with the death of Jacob. Henceforward it is
upon Egypt and the nomad settlers in Goshen that the attention of
the Pentateuch is fixed, until the time comes when the age of the
patriarchs is superseded by that of the legislator, and Moses, the
adopted son of the Egyptian princess, leads his people back to
Canaan. Joseph had been carried by Midianitish hands out of
Palestine into Egypt, there to become the representative of the
Pharaoh, and son-in-law of the high-priest of Heliopolis; for
Moses, the adopted grandson of the Pharaoh, "learned in all the
wisdom of the Egyptians," it was reserved, after years of trial and
preparation in Midian, to bring the descendants of Jacob out of
their Egyptian prison-house to the borders of the Promised
Land.</p>

<h2><a name="chap5" id="chap5">CHAPTER V</a></h2>
<h3>EGYPTIAN TRAVELLERS IN CANAAN</h3>
<p>Palestine has been a land of pilgrims and tourists from the very
beginning of its history. It was the goal of the migration of
Abraham and his family, and it was equally the object of the oldest
book of travels with which we are acquainted. Allusion has already
been made more than once to the Egyptian papyrus, usually known as
<i>The Travels of a Mohar</i>, and in which a satirical account is
given of a tour in Palestine and Syria. The writer was a professor,
apparently of literature, in the court of Ramses II., and he
published a series of letters to his friend, Nekht-sotep, which
were long admired as models of style. Nekht-sotep was one of the
secretaries attached to the military staff, and among the letters
is a sort of parody of an account given by Nekht-sotep of his
adventures in Canaan, which was intended partly to show how an
account of the kind ought to have been written by an accomplished
penman, partly to prove the superiority of the scribe's life to
that of the soldier, partly also, it may be, for the sake of
teasing the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id=
"page205"></a>{205}</span> writer's correspondent. Nekht-sotep had
evidently assumed airs of superiority on the strength of his
foreign travels, and his stay-at-home friend undertook to
demonstrate that he had himself enjoyed the more comfortable life
of the two. Nekht-sotep is playfully dubbed with the foreign title
of Mohar&mdash;or more correctly Muhir&mdash;a word borrowed from
Assyrian, where it primarily signified a military commander and
then the governor of a province.</p>
<p>Long before the days of the nineteenth dynasty, however, there
had been Egyptian travellers in Palestine, or at least in the
adjoining countries. One of the Egyptian books which have come down
to us contains the story of a certain Sinuhit who had to fly from
Egypt in consequence of some political troubles in which he was
involved after the death of Amon-m-hat I. of the twelfth dynasty.
Crossing the Nile near Kher-ahu, the Old Cairo of to-day, he gained
the eastern bank of the river and made his way to the line of forts
which protected Egypt from its Asiatic enemies. Here he crouched
among the desert bushes till night-fall, lest "the watchmen of the
tower" should see him, and then pursued his journey under the cover
of darkness. At daybreak he reached the land of Peten and the wadi
of Qem-uer on the line of the modern Suez Canal. There thirst
seized upon him; his throat rattled, and he said to
himself&mdash;"This is the taste of death." A Bedawi, however,
perceived him and had compassion on the fugitive: he gave him water
and boiled milk, and Sinuhit for a while <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>{206}</span> joined
the nomad tribe. Then he passed on to the country of Qedem, the
Kadmonites of the Old Testament (Gen. xv. 19; Judges vi. 3), whence
came the wise men of the East (1 Kings iv. 30). After spending a
year and a half there, 'Ammu-anshi, the prince of the Upper land of
Tenu, asked the Egyptian stranger to come to him, telling him that
he would hear the language of Egypt. He added that he had already
heard about Sinuhit from "the Egyptians who were in the country."
It is clear from this that there had been intercourse for some time
between Egypt and "the Upper Tenu."</p>
<p>It is probable that Dr. W. Max M&uuml;ller is right in seeing in
Tenu an abbreviated form of Lutennu (or Rutenu), the name by which
Syria was known to the Egyptians. There was an Upper Lutennu and a
Lower Lutennu, the Upper Lutennu corresponding with Palestine and
the adjoining country, and thus including the Edomite district of
which 'Ammu-anshi or Ammi-anshi was king. In the name of
'Ammu-anshi, it may be observed, we have the name of the deity who
appears as Ammi or Ammon in the kingdom of the Ammonites, and
perhaps forms the second element in the name of Balaam. The same
divine name enters into the composition of those of early kings of
Ma'in in Southern Arabia, as well as of Babylonia in the far East.
(See above, p. <a href="#page64">64</a>.)</p>
<p>'Ammu-anshi married Sinuhit to his eldest daughter, and bestowed
upon him the government <span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id=
"page207"></a>{207}</span> of a district called Aia which lay on
the frontier of a neighbouring country. Aia is described as rich in
vines, figs, and olives, in wheat and barley, in milk and cattle.
"Its wine was more plentiful than water," and Sinuhit had "daily
rations of bread and wine, cooked meat and roast fowl," as well as
abundance of game. He lived there for many years. The children born
to him by his Asiatic wife grew up and became heads of tribes. "I
gave water to the thirsty," he says; "I set on his journey the
traveller who had been hindered from passing by; I chastised the
brigand. I commanded the Beduin who departed afar to strike and
repel the princes of foreign lands, and they marched (under me),
for the prince of Tenu allowed that I should be during long years
the general of his soldiers."</p>
<p>Sinuhit, in fact, had given proof of his personal prowess at an
early period in his career. The champion of Tenu had come to him in
his tent and challenged him to single combat. The Egyptian was
armed with bow, arrows, and dagger; his adversary with battle-axe,
javelins, and buckler. The contest was short, and ended in the
decisive victory of Sinuhit, who wounded his rival and despoiled
him of his goods.</p>
<p>A time came, however, when Sinuhit grew old, and began to long
to see once more the land of his fathers before he died.
Accordingly he sent a petition to the Pharaoh praying him to
forgive the offences of his youth and allow him to return again to
Egypt. The petition was granted, and a letter <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>{208}</span> was
despatched to the refugee, permitting him to return. Sinuhit
accordingly quitted the land where he had lived so long. First of
all he held a festival, and handed over his property to his
children, making his eldest son the chief of the tribe. Then he
travelled southward to Egypt, and was graciously received at court.
The coarse garments of the Beduin were exchanged for fine linen;
his body was bathed with water and scented essences; he lay once
more on a couch and enjoyed the luxurious cookery of the Egyptians.
A house and pyramid were built for him; a garden was laid out for
him with a lake and a kiosk, and a golden statue with a robe of
electrum was set up in it. Sinuhit ceased to be an Asiatic
"barbarian," and became once more a civilized Egyptian.</p>
<p>The travels of Sinuhit were involuntary, but a time came when a
tour in Palestine was almost as much the fashion as it is to-day.
The conquests of Thothmes III. had made Syria an Egyptian province,
and had introduced Syrians into the Egyptian bureaucracy. Good
roads were made throughout the newly-acquired territory, furnished
with post-houses where food and lodging could be procured, and
communication between Egypt and Canaan thus became easy and
frequent. The fall of the eighteenth dynasty caused only a
momentary break in the intercourse between the two countries; with
the establishment of the nineteenth dynasty it was again resumed.
Messengers passed backward and forward between Syria and the court
of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id=
"page209"></a>{209}</span> the Pharaoh; Asiatics once more thronged
into the valley of the Nile, and the Egyptian civil servant and
traveller followed in the wake of the victorious armies of Seti and
Ramses. <i>The Travels of a Mohar</i> is the result of this renewed
acquaintance with the cities and roads of Palestine.</p>
<p>The writer is anxious to display his knowledge of Syrian
geography. Though he had not himself ventured to brave the
discomforts of foreign travel, he wished to show that he knew as
much about Canaan as those who had actually been there. A tour
there was after all not much to boast of; it had become so common
that the geography of Canaan was as well known as that of Egypt
itself, and the stay-at-home scribe had consequently no difficulty
in compiling a guide-book to it.</p>
<p>The following is the translation given by Dr. Brugsch of the
papyrus, with such alterations as have been necessitated by further
study and research. "I will portray for thee the likeness of a
Mohar, I will let thee know what he does. Hast thou not gone to the
land of the Hittites, and hast thou not seen the land of Aupa? Dost
thou not know what Khaduma is like; the land of Igad'i also how it
is formed? The Zar (or Plain) of king Sesetsu (Sesostris)&mdash;on
which side of it lies the town of Aleppo, and how is its ford? Hast
thou not taken thy road to Kadesh (on the Orontes) and Tubikhi?
Hast thou not gone to the Shasu (Beduin) with numerous mercenaries,
and hast thou not trodden the way to the Maghar[at] (the caves of
the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id=
"page210"></a>{210}</span> Magoras near Beyrout) where the heaven
is dark in the daytime? The place is planted with maple-trees,
oaks, and acacias, which reach up to heaven, full of beasts, bears
(?), and lions, and surrounded by Shasu in all directions. Hast
thou not ascended the mountain of Shaua, and hast thou not trodden
it? There thy hands hold fast to the [rein] of thy chariot; a jerk
has shaken thy horses in drawing it. I pray thee, let us go to the
city of Beeroth (Beyrout). Hast thou not hastened to its ascent
after passing over the ford in front of it?</p>
<p>"Do thou explain this relish for [the life of] a Mohar! Thy
chariot lies there [before] thee; thy [feet] have fallen lame; thou
treadest the backward path at eventide. All thy limbs are ground
small. Thy [bones] are broken to pieces, and thou dost fall asleep.
Thou awakest: it is the time of gloomy night, and thou art alone.
Has not a thief come to rob thee? Some grooms have entered the
stable; the horse kicks out; the thief has made off in the night,
thy clothes are stolen. Thy groom wakes up in the night; he sees
what has happened to him; he takes what is left, he goes off to bad
company, he joins the Beduin. He transforms himself into an
Asiatic. The police (?) come, they [feel about] for the robber; he
is discovered, and is immovable from terror. Thou wakest, thou
findest no trace of them, for they have carried off thy
property.</p>
<p>"Become [again] a Mohar who is fully accoutred. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>{211}</span> Let thy
ear be filled with that which I relate to thee besides.</p>
<p>"The town 'Hidden'&mdash;such is the meaning of its name
Gebal&mdash;what is its condition? Its goddess [we will speak of]
at another time. Hast thou not visited it? Be good enough to look
out for Beyrout, Sidon, and Sarepta. Where are the fords of the
land of Nazana? The country of Authu (Usu), what is its condition?
They are situated above another city in the sea, Tyre the port is
its name. Drinking-water is brought to it in boats. It is richer in
fishes than in sand. I will tell thee of something else. It is
dangerous to enter Zair'aun. Thou wilt say it is burning with a
very painful sting (?). Come, Mohar. Go forward on the way to the
land of Pa-'Aina. Where is the road to Achshaph (Ekdippa)? Towards
which town? Pray look at the mountain of User. How is its crest?
Where is the mountain of Sakama (Shechem)? Who can surmount it?
Mohar, whither must you take a journey to the land of Hazor? How is
its ford? Show me how one goes to Hamath, Dagara, [and] Dagar-el,
to the place where all Mohars meet? Be good enough to spy out its
road; cast a look on Y&acirc;.... When one goes to the land of
Adamim, to what is one opposite? Do not draw back, but instruct us.
Guide us, that we may know, O leader!</p>
<p>"I will name to thee other cities besides these. Hast thou not
gone to the land of Takhis, to Kafir-Marona, Tamnah, Kadesh, Dapul,
Azai, Harnammata, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id=
"page212"></a>{212}</span> and hast thou not seen Kirjath-Anab,
near Beth-Sopher? and dost thou not know Adullam [and] Zidiputa? Or
dost thou not know any better the name of Khalza in the land of
Aupa, [like] a bull upon its frontiers? Here is the place where all
the mighty warriors are seen. Be good enough to look and see the
chapel of the land of Qina, and tell me about Rehob. Describe
Beth-sha-el (Beth-el) along with Tarqa-el. The ford of the land of
Jordan, how is it crossed? Teach me to know the passage that leads
to the land of Megiddo, which lies in front of it. Verily thou art
a Mohar, well skilled in the work of the strong hand. Pray, is
there found a Mohar like thee, to place at the head of the army, or
a <i>seigneur</i> who can beat thee in shooting?</p>
<p>"Beware of the gorge of the precipice, 2000 cubits deep, which
is full of rocks and boulders. Thou turnest back in a zigzag, thou
bearest thy bow, thou takest the iron in thy left hand. Thou
lettest the old men see, if their eyes are good, how, worn out with
fatigue, thou supportest thyself with thy hand. <i>Ebed gamal Mohar
n'amu</i> ('A camel's slave is the Mohar! they say'); so they say,
and thou gainest a name among the Mohars and the knights of the
land of Egypt. Thy name becomes like that of Qazairnai, the lord of
Asel, when the lions found him in the thicket, in the defile which
is rendered dangerous by the Shasu who lie in ambush among the
trees. They measured four cubits from the nose to the heel, they
had a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id=
"page213"></a>{213}</span> grim look, without softness; they cared
not for caresses.</p>
<p>"Thou art alone, no strong one is with thee, no
<i>arm&eacute;e</i> is behind thee, no <i>Ariel</i> who prepares
the way for thee, and gives thee information of the road before
thee. Thou knowest not the road. The hair on thy head stands on
end; it bristles up. Thy soul is given into thy hands. Thy path is
full of rocks and boulders, there is no outlet near, it is
overgrown with creepers and wolf's-bane. The precipice is on one
side of thee, the mountain and the wall of rock on the other. Thou
drivest in against it. The chariot jumps on which thou art. Thou
art troubled to hold up thy horses. If it falls down the precipice,
the pole drags thee down too. Thy <i>ceintures</i> are pulled away.
They fall down. Thou shacklest the horse, because the pole is
broken on the path of the defile. Not knowing how to tie it up,
thou understandest not how it is to be repaired. The <i>essieu</i>
is left on the spot, as the load is too heavy for the horses. Thy
courage has evaporated. Thou beginnest to run. The heaven is
cloudless. Thou art thirsty; the enemy is behind thee; a trembling
seizes thee; a twig of thorny acacia worries thee; thou thrustest
it aside; the horse is scratched till at length thou findest
rest.</p>
<p>"Explain to me thy liking for [the life of] a Mohar!</p>
<p>"Thou comest into Joppa; thou findest the date-palm in full
bloom in its time. Thou openest wide <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page214" id="page214"></a>{214}</span> thy mouth in order to eat.
Thou findest that the maid who keeps the garden is fair. She does
whatever thou wantest of her.... Thou art recognized, thou art
brought to trial, and owest thy preservation to being a Mohar. Thy
girdle of the finest stuff thou payest as the price of a worthless
rag. Thou sleepest every evening with a rug of fur over thee. Thou
sleepest a deep sleep, for thou art weary. A thief steals thy bow
and thy sword from thy side; thy quiver and thy armour are cut to
pieces in the darkness; thy pair of horses run away. The groom
takes his course over a slippery path which rises before him. He
breaks thy chariot in pieces; he follows thy foot-steps. [He finds]
thy equipments which had fallen on the ground and had sunk into the
sand, leaving only an empty space.</p>
<p>"Prayer does not avail thee, even when thy mouth says, 'Give
food in addition to water, that I may reach my goal in safety,'
they are deaf and will not hear. They say not yes to thy words. The
iron-workers enter into the smithy; they rummage in the workshops
of the carpenters; the handicraftsmen and saddlers are at hand;
they do whatever thou requirest. They put together thy chariot;
they put aside the parts of it that are made useless; thy spokes
are <i>fa&ccedil;onn&eacute;</i> quite new; thy wheels are put on;
they put the <i>courroies</i> on the axles and on the hinder part;
they splice thy yoke, they put on the box of thy chariot; the
[workmen] in iron forge the ...; they put the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>{215}</span> ring that
is wanting on thy whip, they replace the <i>lani&egrave;res</i>
upon it.</p>
<p>"Thou goest quickly onward to fight on the battle-field, to do
the deeds of a strong hand and of firm courage.</p>
<p>"Before I wrote I sought me out a Mohar who knows his power and
leads the <i>jeunesse</i>, a chief in the <i>arm&eacute;e</i>, [who
travels] even to the end of the world.</p>
<p>"Answer me not 'This is good; this is bad;' repeat not to me
your opinion. Come, I will tell thee all that lies before thee at
the end of thy journey.</p>
<p>"I begin for thee with the palace of Sesetsu (Sesostris). Hast
thou not set foot in it by force? Hast thou not eaten the fish in
the brook ...? Hast thou not washed thyself in it? With thy
permission I will remind thee of Huzana; where is its fortress?
Come, I pray thee, to the palace of the land of Uazit, even of
Osymandyas (Ramses II.) in his victories, [to] Saez-el, together
with Absaqbu. I will inform thee of the land of 'Ainin (the two
Springs), the customs of which thou knowest not. The land of the
lake of Nakhai, and the land of Rehoburta thou hast not seen since
thou wast born, O Mohar. Rapih is widely extended. What is its wall
like? It extends for a mile in the direction of Gaza."</p>
<p>The French words introduced from time to time by Dr. Brugsch
into the translation represent the Semitic words which the Egyptian
writer has employed. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id=
"page216"></a>{216}</span> They illustrate the fashionable tendency
of his day to fill the Egyptian vocabulary with the words and
phrases of Canaan. It was the revenge taken by Palestine for its
invasion and conquest by the armies of Seti and Ramses. Thus
<i>arm&eacute;e</i> corresponds to the Semitic <i>tsaba</i>,
"army," <i>jeunesse</i> to <i>na'aruna</i>, "young men." The
Egyptian scribe, however, sometimes made mistakes similar to those
which modern novelists are apt to commit in their French
quotations. Instead of writing, as he intended, <i>'ebed gamal
Mohar na'amu</i> ("a camel's slave is the Mohar! they say"), he has
assigned the Canaanite vowel <i>ayin</i> to the wrong word, and
mis-spelt the name of the "camel," so that the phrase is
transformed into <i>abad kamal Mohar n'amu</i> ("the camel of the
Mohar has perished, they are pleasant"). (It is curious that a
similar mistake in regard to the spelling of <i>'ebed</i>,
"<i>slave</i>" or "<i>servant</i>" has been made in an Aramaic
inscription which I have discovered on the rocks near Silsileh in
Upper Egypt, where the name of Ebed-Nebo is written Abed-Nebo.)</p>
<p>Most of the geographical names mentioned in the papyrus can be
identified. Aupa, the Ubi of the Tel el-Amarna tablets, was on the
borders of the land of the Hittites, and not far from Aleppo. The
Zar or "Plain" of Sesostris makes its appearance in the lists of
conquered towns and countries which were drawn up by Thothmes III.,
Seti I., Ramses II., and Ramses III., in order to commemorate their
victories in Syria. The word probably migrated from Babylonia,
where the <i>zeru</i> <span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id=
"page217"></a>{217}</span> denoted the alluvial plain which lay
between the Tigris and the Euphrates. Kadesh, the southern capital
of the Hittites, "in the land of the Amorites," lay on the Orontes,
close to the lake of Horns, and has been identified by Major Conder
with the modern Tel em-Mindeh. Tubikhi, of which we have already
heard in the Tel el-Amarna letters, is also mentioned in the
geographical lists inscribed by Thothmes III. on the walls of his
temple at Karnak (No. 6); it there precedes the name of Kamta or
Qamdu, the Kumidi of Tel el-Amarna. It is the Tibhath of the Old
Testament, out of which David took "very much brass" (1 Chron.
xviii. 8). The Maghar(at) or "Caves" gave their name to the
Magoras, the river of Beyrout, as well as to the Mearah of the Book
of Joshua (xiii. 4). As for the mountain of Shaua, it is described
by the Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser III. as in the neighbourhood
of the northern Lebanon, while the city of the Beeroth or
"Cisterns" is probably Beyrout.</p>
<p>The Mohar is now carried to Phoenicia. Gebal, Beyrout, Sidon,
and Sarepta, are named one after the other, as the traveller is
supposed to be journeying from north to south. The "goddess" of
Gebal was Baaltis, so often referred to in the letters of
Rib-Hadad, who calls her "the mistress of Gebal." In saying,
however, that the name of the city meant "Hidden," the writer has
been misled by the Egyptian mispronunciation of it. It became
Kapuna in the mouths of his countrymen, and <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>{218}</span> since
<i>kapu</i> in Egyptian signified "hidden mystery," he jumped to
the conclusion that such was also the etymology of the Phoenician
word. In the "fords of the land of Nazana" we must recognize the
river Lit&acirc;ny, which flows into the sea between Sarepta and
Tyre. At all events, Authu or Usu, the next city mentioned, is
associated with Tyre both in the tablets of Tel el-Amarna and in
the inscriptions of the Assyrian kings. It seems to have been the
Pal&aelig;tyros or "Older Tyre" of classical tradition, which stood
on the mainland opposite the more famous insular Tyre. Phoenician
tradition ascribes its foundation to Us&ocirc;os, the offspring of
the mountains of Kasios and Lebanon, and brother of Memrumus, "the
exalted," and Hypsouranios, "the lord of heaven," who was the first
to invent a clothing of skins, and to sail upon the water in boats,
and who had taught mankind to adore the fire and the winds, and to
set up two pillars of stone in honour of the deity. From Usu the
Mohar is naturally taken to the island rock of Tyre.</p>
<p>Next comes a name which it is difficult to identify. All that is
clear is that between Zar or Tyre and Zair'aun there is some
connection both of name and of locality. Perhaps Dr. Brugsch is
right in thinking that in the next sentence there is a play upon
the Hebrew word <i>zir'&acirc;h</i>, "hornet," which seems to have
the same root as Zair'aun. It may be that Zair'aun is the ancient
city south of Tyre whose ruins are now called Umm el-'Am&ucirc;d,
and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id=
"page219"></a>{219}</span> whose older name is said to have been
Tur&acirc;n. Unfortunately the name of the next place referred to
in the Mohar's travels is doubtful; if it is Pa-'A(y)ina, "the
Spring," we could identify it with the modern R&acirc;s el-'Ain,
"the Head of the Spring." This is on the road to Zib, the ancient
Achshaph or Ekdippa.</p>
<p>"The mountain of User" reminds us curiously of the tribe of
Asher, whose territory included the mountain-range which rose up
behind the Phoenician coast. But it may denote Mount Carmel, whose
"crest" faces the traveller as he makes his way southward from Tyre
and Zib. In any case the allusion to it brings to the writer's mind
another mountain in the same neighbourhood, the summit of which
similarly towers into the sky. This is "the mountain of Shechem,"
either Ebal or Gerizim, each of which is nearly 3000 feet above the
level of the sea. It is the first mention that we have of Shechem
outside the pages of the Old Testament.</p>
<p>Shechem, however, did not lie in the path of the Mohar, and the
reference to its mountain is made parenthetically only. We are
therefore carried on to Hazor, which afterwards became a city of
Naphtali, and of which we hear in the letters of Tel el-Amarna.
From Hazor the road ran northwards to Hamath, the Hamah of to-day.
Hazor lay not far to the westward of Adamim, which the geographical
lists of Thothmes III. place between the Sea of Galilee and the
Kishon, and which is <span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id=
"page220"></a>{220}</span> doubtless the Adami of Naphtali (Josh.
xix. 33). Here the tour of the Mohar comes to an abrupt close.
After this the writer contents himself with naming a number of
Syrian cities without regard to their geographical position. He is
anxious merely to show off his knowledge of Canaanitish geography;
perhaps also to insinuate doubts as to the extent of his
correspondent's travels.</p>
<p>Takhis, the Thahash of Gen. xxii. 24, was, as we have seen, in
the land of the Amorites, not very far distant from Kadesh on the
Orontes. Kafir-Marona, "the village of Marona," may have been in
the same direction. The second element in the name is met with
elsewhere in Palestine. Thus one of Joshua's antagonists was the
king of Shim-ron-meron (Josh. xii. 20), and the Assyrian
inscriptions tell us of a town called Samsi-muruna. Tamnah was not
an uncommon name. We hear of a Tamnah or Timnah in Judah (Josh. xv.
57), and of another in Mount Ephraim (Josh. xix. 50). Dapul may be
the Tubuliya of the letters of Rib-Hadad, Azai, "the outlet," seems
to have been near a pass, while Har-nammata, "the mountain of
Nammata," is called Har-nam by Ramses III., who associates it with
Lebanoth and Hebron. The two next names, Kirjath-Anab and
Beth-Sopher, are of peculiar interest, since they contain the first
mention that was come down to us of Kitjath-Sepher, the literary
centre of the Canaanites in the south of Palestine, which was
captured and destroyed by Othniel the Kenizzite. In the Old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id=
"page221"></a>{221}</span> Testament (Josh. xv. 49, 50)
Kirjath-Sannah or Kirjath-Sepher and Anab are coupled together just
as Kirjath-Anab and Beth-Sopher are by the Egyptian scribe, and it
is therefore evident that he has interchanged the place of the
equivalent terms Kirjath, "city," and Beth, "house." But his
spelling of the second name shows us how it ought to be punctuated
and read in the Old Testament. It was not Kirjath-Sepher, "the city
of book(s)," but Kirjath-Sopher, "the city of scribe(s)," and Dr.
W. Max M&uuml;ller has pointed out that the determinative of
"writing" has been attached to the word <i>Sopher</i>, showing that
the writer was fully acquainted with its meaning. Kirjath-Sannah,
"the city of instruction," as it was also called, was but another
way of emphasizing the fact that here was the site of a library and
school such as existed in the towns of Babylonia and Assyria. Both
names, however, Kirjath-Sopher and Kirjath-Sannah, were descriptive
rather than original; its proper designation seems to have been
Debir, "the sanctuary," the temple wherein its library was
established, and which has caused the Egyptian author to call it a
"Beth," or "temple," instead of a "Kirjath," or "city."</p>
<p>Like Anab and Kirjath-Sopher, Adullam and Zidiputa were also in
southern Canaan. It was in the cave of Adullam that David took
refuge from the pursuit of Saul, and we learn from Shishak that
Zidiputa&mdash;or Zadiputh-el, as he calls it&mdash;was in the
south of Judah. From hence we are suddenly <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>{222}</span>
transported to the northern part of Syria, and the Mohar is asked
if he knows anything about Khalza in the land of Aupa. Khalza is an
Assyrian word signifying "Fortress," and Aupa, the Ubi of the Tel
el-Amarna tablets, was not far from Aleppo. The allusion to the
"bull" is obscure.</p>
<p>Then once more we are summoned back to Palestine. In the annals
of Thothmes III. we are told that "the brook of Qina" was to the
south of Megiddo, so that the name of the district has probably
survived in that of "Cana of Galilee." Rehob may be Rehob in Asher
(Josh. xix. 28), which was near Kanah, though the name is so common
in Syria as to make any identification uncertain. Beth-sha-el, on
the contrary, is Beth-el. We first meet with the name in the
geographical lists of Thothmes III., and the fact that it is
Babylonian in form, Bit-sa-ili being the Babylonian equivalent of
the Hebrew Beth-el, is one of many proofs that the lists were
compiled from a cuneiform original. The name of Beth-sha-el or
Beth-el calls up that of Tarqa-el, which contains the name of the
Hittite god Tarqu. But where Tarqa-el was situated it is impossible
to say.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the book reference is made to certain places
which lay on the road between Egypt and Canaan. Rapih is the Raphia
of classical geography, the Rapikh of the Assyrian inscriptions,
where two broken columns now mark the boundary between Egypt and
Turkey. Rehoburta <span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id=
"page223"></a>{223}</span> is probably the Rehoboth where the
herdsmen of Isaac dug a well before the patriarch moved to
Beer-sheba (Gen. xxvi. 22), while in the lake of Nakhai we may have
the Sirbonian lake of classical celebrity.</p>
<p>There still remain two allusions in the papyrus which must not
be passed over in silence. One is the allusion to "Qazairnai, the
lord of Asel," the famous slayer of lions. We know nothing further
about this Nimrod of Syria, but Professor Maspero is doubtless
right in believing that Asel ought to be written Alsa, and that the
country meant was the kingdom of Alasiya, which lay in the northern
portion of Coele-Syria. Several letters from the king of Alasiya
are preserved in the Tel el-Amarna collection, and we gather from
them that his possessions extended across the Orontes from the
desert to the Mediterranean Sea. Egyptian papyri tell us that mares
were imported into Egypt from Alasiya as well as two different
kinds of liquor. In the age of Samuel and Saul Alasiya was governed
by a queen.</p>
<p>The second allusion is to the ironsmith in Canaan. It is clear
that there were many of them, and that it was to the worker in iron
and not to the worker in bronze that the traveller naturally turned
when his chariot needed mending. Even the word that is employed to
denote the metal is the Canaanitish <i>barzel</i>, which has been
adopted under the form of <i>parzal</i>. Nothing could show more
plainly how characteristic of Canaan the trade of the ironsmith
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id=
"page224"></a>{224}</span> must have been, and how largely the use
of iron must have there superseded the use of bronze. The fact is
in accordance with the references in the annals of Thothmes III. to
the iron that was received by him from Syria; it is also in
accordance with the statements of the Bible, where we read of the
"chariots of iron" in which the Canaanites rode to war. Indeed
there seems to have been a special class of wandering ironsmiths in
Palestine, like the wandering ironsmiths of medi&aelig;val Europe,
who jealously guarded the secrets of their trade, and formed not
only a peculiar caste, but even a peculiar race. The word Kain
means "a smith," and the nomad Kenites of whom we read in the Old
Testament were simply the nomad race of "smiths," whose home was
the tent or cavern. Hence it was that while they were not
Israelites, they were just as little Canaanites, and hence it was
too that the Philistines were able to deprive the Israelites of the
services of a smith (1 Sam. xiii. 19). All that was necessary was
to prevent the Kenites from settling within Israelitish territory.
There was no Israelite who knew the secrets of the profession and
could take their place, and the Canaanites who lived under
Israelitish protection were equally ignorant of the ironsmith's
art. Though the ironsmith had made himself a home in Canaan he
never identified himself with its inhabitants. The Kenites remained
a separate people, and could consequently be classed as such by the
side of the Hivites, or "villagers," and the Perizzites, or
"fellahin."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id=
"page225"></a>{225}</span>
<p>If the <i>Travels of a Mohar</i> are a guide-book to the
geography of Palestine in the age of the nineteenth Egyptian
dynasty, the lists of places conquered by Thothmes III., and
engraved by his orders on the walls of his temple at Karnak, are a
sort of atlas of Canaanite geography in the age of the eighteenth
dynasty. The name of each locality is enclosed in a cartouche and
surmounted by the head and shoulders of a Canaanitish captive. The
hair and eyes of the figures are painted black or rather dark
purple, while the skin is alternately red and yellow. The yellow
represents the olive tint of the Mediterranean population, the red
denotes the effects of sunburn. An examination of the names
contained in the cartouches makes it clear that they have been
derived from the memoranda made by the scribes who accompanied the
army of the Pharaoh in its campaigns. Sometimes the same name is
repeated twice, and not always in the same form. We may conclude,
therefore, that the memoranda had not always been made by the same
reporter, and that the compiler of the lists drew his materials
from different sources. It is further clear that the memoranda had
been noted down in the cuneiform characters of Babylonia and not in
the hieroglyphs of Egypt. Thus, as we have seen, the name of
Beth-el is transcribed from its Babylonian form of Bit-sa-ili, the
Assyrian equivalent of the Hebrew Beth-el.</p>
<p>The names have been copied from the memoranda of the scribes in
the order in which they <span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id=
"page226"></a>{226}</span> occurred, and without any regard to
their relative importance. While, therefore, insignificant villages
are often noted, the names of important cities are sometimes passed
over. Descriptive epithets, moreover, like <i>abel</i> "meadow,"
<i>arets</i> "land," <i>har</i> "mountains," <i>'emeq</i> "valley,"
<i>'&ecirc;n</i> "spring," are frequently treated as if they were
local names, and occupy separate cartouches. We must not,
consequently, expect to find in the lists any exhaustive catalogue
of Palestinian towns or even of the leading cities. They mark only
the lines of march taken by the army of Thothmes or by his scouts
and messengers.</p>
<p>Besides the Canaanitish lists there are also long lists of
localities conquered by the Pharaoh in Northern Syria. With these,
however, we have nothing to do. It is to the places in Canaan that
our attention must at present be confined. They are said to be
situated in the country of the Upper Lotan, or, as another list
gives it, in the country of the Fenkhu. In the time of Thothmes
III. accordingly the land of the Upper Lotan and the land of the
Fenkhu were synonymous terms, and alike denoted what we now call
Palestine. In the word Fenkhu it is difficult not to see the origin
of the Greek Phoenix or "Phoenician."</p>
<p>The lists begin with Kadesh on the Orontes, the head of the
confederacy, the defeat of which laid Canaan at the feet of the
Pharaoh. Then comes Megiddo, where the decisive battle took place,
and the forces of the king of Kadesh were overthrown. Next we have
Khazi, mentioned also in the Tel <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page227" id="page227"></a>{227}</span> el-Amarna tablets, from
which we learn that it was in the hill-country south of Megiddo. It
may be the Gaza of 1 Chron. vii. 28 which was supplanted by Shechem
in Israelitish days. Kitsuna, the Kuddasuna of the Tel el-Amarna
tablets, follows: where it stood we do not know. The next name,
"the Spring of Shiu," is equally impossible to identify. The sixth
name, however, is Tubikhu, about which the cuneiform tablets of Tel
el-Amarna have told us a good deal, and which seems to be the
Tibhath of 1 Chron. xviii. 8. It was in Coele-Syria like Kamta, the
Kumidi of the tablets, which follows in one list, though its place
is taken by the unknown Bami in another. After this we have the
names of Tuthina (perhaps Dothan), Lebana, and Kirjath-niznau,
followed by Marum or Merom the modern Meir&ocirc;m, by Tamasqu or
Damascus, by the Abel of Atar, and by Hamath. Aqidu, the
seventeenth name, is unknown, but Mr. Tomkins is probably right in
thinking that the next name, that of Shemnau, must be identified
with the Shimron of Josh. xix. 15, where the Septuagint reads
Symeon. That this reading is correct is shown by the fact that in
the days of Josephus and the Talmud the place was called Simonias,
while the modern name is Sem&ucirc;nieh. The tablets of Tel
el-Amarna make it Samkhuna.</p>
<p>Six unknown names come next, the first of which is a Beeroth, or
"Wells." Then we have Mesekh, "the place of unction," called
Musikhuna in the Tel el-Amarna correspondence, Qana and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id=
"page228"></a>{228}</span> 'Arna. Both Qana and 'Arna appear in the
account of the battle before Megiddo, and must have been in the
immediate neighbourhood of that city. One of the affluents of the
Kishon flowed past Qana, while 'Arna was hidden in a defile. It was
there that the tent of Thothmes was pitched two days before the
great battle. The brook of Qana seems to have been the river Qanah
of to-day, and 'Arna may be read 'Aluna.</p>
<p>We are now transported to the eastern bank of the Jordan, to
'Astartu in the land of Bashan, the Ashtaroth-Karnaim of Genesis,
the Tel 'Ashtarah of modern geography. With 'Astartu is coupled
Anau-repa, explained by Mr. Tomkins to be "On of the Rephaim" (Gen.
xiv. 5). At any rate it is clearly the Raphon or Raphana of
classical writers, the Er-Rafeh of to-day. Next we have Maqata,
called Makhed in the First Book of Maccabees, and now known as
Mukatta; Lus or Lius, the Biblical Laish, which under its later
name of Dan became the northern limit of the Israelitish kingdom;
and Hazor, the stronghold of Jabin, whose king we hear of in the
Tel el-Amarna tablets. Then come Pahil or Pella, east of the
Jordan, famous in the annals of early Christianity; Kennartu, the
Chinneroth of the Old Testament (Josh. xi. 2, 1 Kings xv. 20), from
which the Sea of Galilee took one of its names; Shemna, the site of
which is uncertain; and Atmam, the Adami of Josh. xix. 33. These
are followed by Qasuna, in which we find the Kishion of Issachar
(Josh. xix. 20); Shanam <span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id=
"page229"></a>{229}</span> or Shunem, now S&ocirc;lam, north of
Jezreel; Mash-al, the Misheal of Scripture; and Aksap or Ekdippa on
the Phoenician coast. Then after a name which cannot be identified
we read those of Ta'anak, the Ta'anach of the Bible, the Ta'anuk of
to-day; Ible'am, near which Ahaziah of Jadah was slain by the
servants of Jehu; Gantu-Asna, "the garden of Asnah"; Lot-melech,
"Lot of the king"; 'Aina, "the Spring"; and 'Aak or Acre. From Acre
we are taken along the coast southward to Rosh Kadesh, "the sacred
headland" of Carmel, whose name follows immediately under the form
of Karimna. Next we have Beer, "the Well," Shemesh-Atum, and
Anakhertu. Anakhertu is the Anaharath of Josh. xix. 19, which
belonged to the tribe of Issachar.</p>
<p>Of Shemesh-Atum we hear again in one of the inscriptions of
Amenophis III. A revolt had broken out in the district of the
Lebanon, and the king accordingly marched into Canaan to suppress
it. Shemesh-Atum was the first city to feel the effects of his
anger, and he carried away from it eighteen prisoners and thirteen
oxen. The name of the town shows that it was dedicated to the
Sun-god. In Hebrew it would appear as Shemesh-Edom, and an Egyptian
papyrus, now at Leyden, informs us that Atum or Edom was the wife
of Resheph the Canaanitish god of fire and lightning. In
Shemesh-Atum or Shemesh-Edom we therefore have a compound name
signifying that the Shemesh or Sun-god denoted by it was not the
male divinity <span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id=
"page230"></a>{230}</span> of the customary worship, but the
Sun-goddess Edom. In Israelitish times the second element in the
compound seems to have been dropped; at all events it is probable
that Shemesh-Atum was the Beth-Shemesh of the Old Testament (Josh.
xix. 22), which is mentioned along with Anaharath as in the borders
of Issachar.</p>
<p>After Anaharath come two unknown Ophrahs; then Khasbu and
Tasult, called Khasabu and Tusulti in the Tel el-Amarna letters;
then Negebu, perhaps the Nekeb of Galilee (Josh. xix. 33),
Ashushkhen, Anam, and Yurza. Yurza is now represented by the ruins
of Yerza, south-eastward of Ta'anach, and there are letters from
its governor in the Tel el-Amarna collection. Its name is followed
by those of Makhsa, Yapu or Joppa, and "the country of Gantu" or
Gath. Next we have Luthen or Ruthen, which is possibly Lydda, Ono,
Apuqen, Suka or Socho, and Yahem. Among the cartouches that follow
we read the names of a Migdol, of Shebtuna, the modern
Shebt&icirc;n, of Naun which reminds us of the name of Joshua's
father, and of Haditha, now Had&icirc;theh, five miles to the west
of Shebt&icirc;n.</p>
<p>The list has thus led us to the foot of Mount Ephraim, and it is
not surprising that the next name should be that of the Har or
"Mountain" itself. This is followed by a name which is full of
interest, for it reads Joseph-el or "Joseph-god." How the name of
Joseph came to be attached in the time of Thothmes to the
mountainous region <span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id=
"page231"></a>{231}</span> in which "the House of Joseph"
afterwards established itself is hard to explain; we must remember,
however, as has been stated in a former chapter, that according to
the Chronicler (1 Chron. vii. 21, 22), already in the lifetime of
Ephraim his sons were slain by the men of Gath, "because they came
down to take away their cattle." (Mr. Pinches tells me that in
early Babylonian contracts of the age of Chedor-laomer he has found
the name of Yasupu-ilu or Joseph-el, as well as that of Yakub-ilu
or Jacob-el. The discovery is of high importance when we remember
that Abraham migrated from Ur of the Chaldees, and adds another to
the many debts of gratitude due to Mr. Pinches from Biblical
students. See Preface for further details.)</p>
<p>Three names further on we find another compound with <i>el</i>,
Har-el, "the mount of God." In Ezek. xliii. 15 Har-el is used to
denote the "altar" which should stand in the temple on Mount
Moriah, and Mount Moriah is itself called "the Mount of the Lord"
in the Book of Genesis (xxii. 14). It may be, therefore, that in
the Har-el of the Egyptian list we have the name of the mountain
whereon the temple of Solomon was afterwards to be built. However
this may be, the names which follow it show that we are in the
neighbourhood of Jerusalem. One after the other come Lebau, Na'mana
or Na'amah (Josh. xv. 41), Meromim "the heights," 'Ani "the two
springs," Rehob, Ekron, Hekalim "the palaces," the Abel or "meadow"
of Autar'a, the Abel, the Gantau or "gardens," the Maqerput or
"tilled ground," and the 'Aina or "Spring" of Carmel, which
corresponds with the Gath-Carmel <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page232" id="page232"></a>{232}</span> of the Tel el-Amarna
tablets, the Carmel of Judah of the Old Testament. Then we have
Beth-Ya, a name which reminds us of that of "Bithia, the daughter
of Pharaoh," whom Mered, the descendant of Caleb, took to wife, and
whose stepson was Yered, "the father of Gedor" (1 Chron. iv. 18).
Beth-Ya is followed by Tapun, which was fortified by the Greeks
after the death of Judas Maccabaeus (1 Macc. ix. 50), by the Abel
of Yertu or Yered, perhaps the district of the Jordan, by Halkal,
and by Jacob-el, a name formed in the same way as that of
Joseph-el. We may see in it an evidence that the memory of the
patriarch was kept alive in the south of Palestine. The next two
names are unknown, but they are followed by Rabatu or Rabbah of
Judah, Magharatu, the Ma'arath of Josh, xv. 59, 'Emequ, "the
valley" of Hebron, Sirta and B&acirc;rtu, the <i>Bar has-Sirak</i>,
or "Well of Sirah" of 2 Sam. iii. 26. Then come Beth-sa-el or
Beth-el in its Babylonian dress; Beth-Anta or Beth-Anath (Josh. xv.
59), where the Babylonian goddess Anatu was worshipped; Helkath (2
Sam. ii. 16); the Spring of Qan'am; Gibeah of Judah (2 Sam. vi. 3,
4; see Josh. xviii. 28); Zelah (Josh. xviii. 28), called Zilu by
Ebed-Tob of Jerusalem; and Zafta, the Biblical Zephath (Judges i.
17). The last three names in the catalogue&mdash;Barqna, Hum, and
Aktomes&mdash;have left no traces in Scriptural or classical
geography.</p>
<p>The geographical lists of Thothmes III. served as a model for
the Pharaohs who came after him. They also adorned the walls of
their temples with <span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id=
"page233"></a>{233}</span> the names of the places they had
captured in Palestine, in Northern Syria, and in the Soudan, and
when a large space had to be filled the sculptor was not careful to
insert in it only the names of such foreign towns as had been
actually conquered. The older lists were drawn upon, and the names
which had appeared in them were appropriated by the later king,
sometimes in grotesquely misspelt forms. The climax of such empty
claims to conquests which had never been made was reached at Kom
Ombo, where Ptolemy Lathyrus, a prince who, instead of gaining
fresh territory, lost what he had inherited, is credited with the
subjugation of numerous nations and races, many of whom, like the
Hittites, had long before vanished from the page of history. The
last of the Pharaohs whose geographical list really represents his
successes in Palestine was Shishak, the opponent of Rehoboam and
the founder of the twenty-second dynasty. The catalogue of places
engraved on the wall of the shrine he built at Karnak is a genuine
and authentic record.</p>
<p>So too are the lists given by the kings who immediately followed
Thothmes III., Amenophis III. of the eighteenth dynasty, Seti I.
and Ramses II. of the nineteenth, and Ramses III. of the twentieth.
It is true that in some cases the list of one Pharaoh has been
slavishly copied by another, but it is also true that these
Pharaohs actually overran and subjugated the countries to which the
lists belong. Of this we have independent testimony.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id=
"page234"></a>{234}</span>
<p>At one time it was the fashion to throw doubt on the alleged
conquests of Ramses II. in Western Asia. This was the natural
reaction from the older belief, inherited from the Greek writers of
antiquity, that Ramses II. was a universal conqueror who had
carried his arms into Europe, and even to the confines of the
Caucasus. With the overthrow of this belief came a disbelief in his
having been a conqueror at all. The disbelief was encouraged by the
boastful vanity of his inscriptions, as well as by the absence in
them of any details as to his later Syrian wars.</p>
<p>But we now know that such scepticism was over-hasty. It was like
the scepticism which refused to admit that Canaan had been made an
Egyptian province by Thothmes III., and which needed the testimony
of the Tel el-Amarna tablets before it could be removed. As a
matter of fact, Egyptian authority was re-established throughout
Palestine and even on the eastern bank of the Jordan during the
reign of Ramses II., and the conquests of the Pharaoh in Northern
Syria were real and not imaginary. Such has been the result of the
discoveries of the last three or four years.</p>
<p>We have no reason to doubt that the campaigns of Ramses III. in
Asia were equally historical. The great confederacy of northern
barbarians and Asiatic invaders which had poured down upon Egypt
had been utterly annihilated; the Egyptian army was flushed with
victory, and Syria, overrun as it had been by the invaders from the
north, was <span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id=
"page235"></a>{235}</span> in no position to resist a fresh attack.
Moreover, the safety of Egypt required that Ramses should follow up
the destruction of his assailants by carrying the war into Asia.
But it is noticeable that the places he claims to have conquered,
whether in Canaan or further north, lay along the lines of two
high-roads, and that the names of the great towns even on these
high-roads are for the most part conspicuously absent. The names,
however, are practically those already enumerated by Ramses II.,
and they occur in the same order. But the list given by Ramses III.
could not have been copied from the older list of Ramses II. for a
very sufficient reason. In some instances the names as given by the
earlier monarch are mis-spelt, letters having been omitted in them
or wrong letters having been written in place of the right ones,
while in the list of Ramses III. the same names are correctly
written.</p>
<p>Seti I., the father of Ramses II., seems to have been too fully
engaged in his wars in Northern Syria, and in securing the road
along the coast of the Mediterranean, to attempt the re-conquest of
Palestine. At Qurnah, however, we find the names of 'Aka or Acre,
Zamith, Pella, Beth-el (Beth-sha-il), Inuam, Kimham (Jer. xli. 17),
Kamdu, Tyre, Usu, Beth-Anath, and Carmel among those of the cities
he had vanquished, but there is no trace of any occupation of
Southern Canaan. That seems to have come later with the beginning
of his son's reign.</p>
<p>On the walls of the Ramesseum at Thebes there <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>{236}</span> are
pictures of the storming and capture of the Palestinian cities.
Most of them are now destroyed, but we can still read the names of
Ashkelon, of Salem or Jerusalem, of Beth-Anath and Qarbu[tu], of
Dapul in the land of the Amorites, of Merom, of Damascus, and of
Inuam. Elsewhere we have mention of Yurza and Socho, while at
Karnak there are two geographical lists which mark two of the lines
of march taken by the troops of Ramses II. The first list contains
the following names: (1) the district of Salem; (2) the district of
Rethpana; (3) the country of the Jordan; (4) Khilz; (5) Karhu; (6)
Uru; (7) Abel; (8) Carmel; (9) the upper district of Tabara or
Debir; (10) Shimshon; and (n) Erez Hadashta, "the new land." In the
second list we read: (1) Rosh Kadesh, or Mount Carmel; (2) Inzat;
(3) Maghar; (4) Rehuza; (5) Saabata; (6) Gaza; (7) the district of
Sala'; (8) the district of Zasr; (9) Jacob-el; and (10) the land of
Akrith, the Ugarit of the Tel el-Amarna tablets.</p>
<p>We have already seen that long before the time of Ramses II.
Jerusalem was an important city and fortress, the capital of a
territory of some size, known by the name of Uru-Salim, "the city
of the god of peace." "The city of Salem" could easily be
abbreviated into "Salem" only; and it is accordingly Salem which
alone is used in the fourteenth chapter of Genesis as well as in
the inscriptions of Ramses II. and Ramses III. The name of
Rethpana, which follows that of Salem, is faultily <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>{237}</span> written
in the list of Ramses II., and it is from that of Ramses III. that
we have to recover its true form. Ramses III., moreover, tells us
that Rethpana was a lake, and since its name comes between those of
Jerusalem and the Jordan it must represent the Dead Sea. The
Canaanite form of Rethpana would be Reshpon, a derivative from the
name of Resheph, the god of fire and lightning, whose name is
preserved in that of the town Arsuf, and whose "children" were the
sparks (Job v. 7). The name was appropriate to a region which was
believed to have been smitten with a tempest of flames, and of
which we are told that "the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon
Gomorrah brimstone and fire."</p>
<p>Khilz, the fourth name in the list, is probably the Babylonian
<i>Khalzu</i>, or "fortress." At all events it was the first town
on the eastern side of the Jordan, and it may well therefore have
guarded the ford across the river. Karhu is the Korkha of the
Moabite Stone, perhaps the modern Kerak, which was the capital of
Moab in the age of Ahab, and Uru is the Babylonian form of the
Moabite Ar, or "city," of which we read in the Book of Numbers
(xxi. 28). The land of "Moab" itself is one of the countries which
Ramses claims to have subdued. The Carmel mentioned in the list is
Carmel of Judah, not the more famous Carmel on the coast. As for
Tabara or Debir, it will be that ancient seat of Canaanite learning
and literature, called Kirjath-Sepher and Debir in the Old
Testament, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id=
"page238"></a>{238}</span> the site of which is unfortunately still
unknown. It must have lain, however, between Carmel and Shimshon,
"the city of the Sun-god," with which it is probable that the
Biblical Ir-Shemesh should be identified (Josh. xix. 41). Erez
Hadashta, "the New Land," is called Hadashah in the Book of Joshua
(xv. 37), where it is included among the possessions of Judah.</p>
<p>The second list, instead of taking us through Judah and Moab,
leads us southward along the coast from Mount Carmel. Maghar is
termed by Ramses III. "the spring of the Maghar," and is the
Magoras or river of Beyrout of classical geography. The river took
its name from the <i>maghdrat</i> or "caves" past which it runs,
and of which we have already heard in the <i>Travels of a
Mohar</i>. The two next names which represent places on the coast
to the north of Gaza are quite unknown, but Sala', which is written
Selakh by Ramses III. (from a cuneiform original), is possibly the
rock-city Sela (2 Kings xiv. 7), better known to us as Petra. Of
Jacob-el we have already had occasion to speak.</p>
<p>It is in the ruined temple of Medinet Habu that Ramses III. has
recorded his victories and inscribed the names of the peoples and
cities he had overcome. We gather from the latter that his armies
had followed the roads already traversed by Ramses II., had marched
through the south of Palestine into Moab, and had made their way
along the sea-coast into Northern Syria. One after the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id=
"page239"></a>{239}</span> we read the names of Hir-nam or Har-nam,
called Har-Nammata in the <i>Mohar's Travels</i>, of Lebanoth, of
Beth-Anath and Qarbutu (Josh. xv. 59), of Carmim, "the vineyards,"
and Shabuduna or Shebt&icirc;n, of Mashabir (?), of Hebron and its
'&Egrave;n or "Spring," of the "district of Libnah," of 'Aphekah
and 'Abakhi (Josh. xv. 53), of Migdal&mdash;doubtless the
Migdal-Gad of Josh. xv. 53&mdash;and Qarzak, of Carmel of Judah and
the Upper District of Debir, of Shimshon and Erez Hadasth, of the
district of Salem or Jerusalem and the "Lake of Rethpana," of the
Jordan, of Khilz the fortress, of Korkha and of Uru. A second list
gives us the line of march along the shores of the Mediterranean
Sea. First we have 'Akata, perhaps Joktheel in Judah (Josh. xv.
38), then Karka and [Zidi]puth, Abel and the district of Sela', the
district of Zasr and Jacob-el, Rehuza, Saaba and Gaza, Rosh-Kadesh,
Inzath and the "Spring," Lui-el, which we might also read Levi-el,
Bur, "the Cistern," Kamdu, "Qubur the great," Iha, Tur, and finally
Sannur, the Saniru of the Assyrian texts, the Shenir of the Old
Testament (Deut. iii. 9). This brings us to Mount Hermon and the
land of the Amorites, so that it is not surprising to find after
two more names that of Hamath.</p>
<p>One point about this list is very noticeable. None of the great
Phoenician cities of the coast are mentioned in it. Acre, Ekdippa,
Tyre, Sidon, and Beyrout are all conspicuous by their absence. Even
Joppa is unnamed. After Gaza we have <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page240" id="page240"></a>{240}</span> only descriptive epithets
like "the Spring" and "the Cistern," or the names of otherwise
unknown villages. With Kamdu in Coele-Syria the catalogue of cities
begins afresh.</p>
<p>It is plain that the northern campaign of the Pharaoh was little
better than a raid. No attempt was made to capture the cities of
the coast, and re-establish in them the Egyptian power. The
Egyptian army passed them by without any effort to reduce them.
Possibly the Philistines had already settled on the coast, and had
shown themselves too strong to be meddled with; possibly the
Egyptian fleet was acting in concert with the troops on land, and
Ramses cared only to lead his forces to some spot on the north
Syrian coast, from whence, if necessary, the ships could convey
them home. Whatever may have been the reason, the fact remains that
Gaza alone of the cities of the Canaanitish coast fell into the
hands of the Pharaoh. It was only in the extreme south, in what was
so soon afterwards to become the territory of Judah, that he
overran the country and occupied the large towns.</p>
<p>With the lists of Ramses III. our knowledge of the geography of
Patriarchal Palestine is brought to a close. Henceforward we have
to do with the Canaan of Israelitish conquest and settlement. The
records of the Old Testament contain a far richer store of
geographical names than we can ever hope to glean from the
monuments of Egypt. But the latter show how little change after all
was <span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id=
"page241"></a>{241}</span> effected by the Israelitish conquest in
the local nomenclature of the country. A few cities disappeared
like Kirjath-Sepher, but on the whole not only the cities, but even
the villages of pre-Israelitish Canaan survived under their old
names. When we compare the names of the towns and villages of Judah
enumerated in the Book of Joshua with the geographical lists of a
Thothmes or a Ramses, we cannot but be struck by the coincidences
between them. The occurrence of a name like Hadashah, "the New
(Land)," in both cannot be the result of chance. It adds one more
to the many arguments in favour of the antiquity of the Book of
Joshua, or at all events of the materials of which it consists.
Geography, at all events, gives no countenance to the theory which
sees in the book a fabrication of later date. Even the leading
cities of the Israelitish period are for the most part already the
leading cities of the earlier Palestine. The future capital of
David, for example, was already called Jerusalem long before the
birth of Moses, and already occupied a foremost place among the
kingdoms of Canaan.</p>

<h2><a name="chap6" id="chap6">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>
<h3>CANAANITISH CULTURE AND RELIGION</h3>
<p>We have already learned from the annals of Thothmes III. how
high was the state of civilization and culture among the merchant
princes of Canaan in the age of the eighteenth Egyptian dynasty.
Artistically finished vases of gold and silver, rich bronzes,
furniture carved out of ebony and cedar, and inlaid with ivory and
precious stones&mdash;such were some of the manufactures of the
land of Palestine. Iron was excavated from its hills and wrought
into armour, into chariots, and into weapons of war; while
beautifully shaped vessels of variegated glass were manufactured on
the coast. The amber beads found at Lachish point to a trade with
the distant Baltic, and it is possible that there may be truth
after all in the old belief, that the Phoenicians obtained their
tin from the isles of Britain. The mines of Cyprus, indeed, yielded
abundance of copper, but, so far as we know, there were only two
parts of the world from which the nations of Western Asia and the
Eastern Mediterranean could have procured the vast <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>{243}</span> amount of
tin needed in the Bronze Age&mdash;the Malayan Peninsula and
Cornwall. The Malayan Peninsula is out of the question&mdash;there
are no traces of any commercial intercourse so far to the East; and
it would seem, therefore, that we must look to Cornwall for the
source of the tin. If so the trade would probably have been
overland, like the amber trade from the Baltic.</p>
<p>Canaan was marked out by Nature to be a land of merchants. Its
long line of coast fronted the semi-barbarous populations of Asia
Minor, of the &AElig;gean, and of the northern shores of Africa,
while the sea furnished it with the purple dye of the murex. The
country itself formed the high-road and link between the great
kingdoms of the Euphrates and the Nile. It was here that the two
civilizations of Babylonia and Egypt met and coalesced, and it was
inevitable that the Canaanites, who possessed all the energy and
adaptive quickness of a commercial race, should absorb and combine
the elements of both. There was little except this combination that
was original in Canaanitish art, but when once the materials were
given, the people of Palestine knew how to work them up into new
and graceful forms, and adapt them practically to the needs of the
foreign world.</p>
<p>If we would realize the change brought about by this contact of
Canaan with the culture of the stranger, we must turn to the rude
figures carved upon the rocks in some of the valleys of Phoenicia.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id=
"page244"></a>{244}</span> Near Tyre, for example, in the Wadi
el-Qana we may still see some of these primitive sculptures, in
which it is difficult even to recognize the human form. Equally
barbarous in style are the early seals and cylinders made in
imitation of those of Babylonia. It seems at first sight impossible
to believe that such grotesque and child-like beginnings should
have ended in the exquisite art of the age of Thothmes III.</p>
<p>At that period, however, Canaan already had behind it a long
civilized past. The country was filled with schools and libraries,
with richly-furnished palaces, and the workshops of the artisans.
The cities on the coast had their fleets partly of merchantmen,
partly of warships, and an active trade was carried on with all
parts of the known world. The result was that the wealth of
Palestine was enormous; the amount carried away by Thothmes is
alone sufficient to prove it. Apart from the natural productions of
the country&mdash;corn, wine, and oil, or the slaves which it had
to furnish&mdash;immense quantities of gold, silver, and precious
stones, sometimes in their native state, sometimes manufactured
into artistic forms, were transported into Egypt. And in spite of
this drain upon its resources, the supply seems never to have
failed.</p>
<p>The reciprocal influence of the civilizations of Canaan and
Egypt one upon the other, in the days when Canaan was an Egyptian
province, is reflected in the languages of the two countries. On
the one <span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id=
"page245"></a>{245}</span> hand the Canaanite borrowed from Egypt
words like <i>tebah</i> "ark," <i>hin</i> "a measure," and
<i>eby&ocirc;n</i> "poor," while Canaan in return copiously
enriched the vocabulary of its conquerors. As the <i>Travels of a
Mohar</i> have shown us, under the nineteenth dynasty there was a
mania for using Canaanitish words and phrases, similar to that
which has more than once visited English society in respect to
French. But before the rise of the nineteenth dynasty the Egyptian
lexicon was already full of Semitic words. Frequently they denoted
objects which had been imported from Syria. Thus a "chariot" was
called a <i>merkabut</i>, a "waggon" being <i>agolta</i>;
<i>hurpu</i>, "a sword," was the Canaanitish <i>khereb</i>, just as
<i>aspata</i>, "a quiver," was <i>ashp&acirc;h</i>. The Canaanitish
<i>kinnor</i>, "a lyre," was similarly naturalized in Egypt, like
the names of certain varieties of "Syrian bread." The Egyptian
words for "incense" (<i>qadaruta</i>), "oxen" (<i>abiri</i>), and
"sea" (<i>yum</i>) were taken from the same source, though it is
possible that the last-mentioned word, like <i>qamhu</i>, "wheat,"
had been introduced from Syria in the earliest days of Egyptian
history. As might have been expected, several kinds of sea-going
vessels brought with them their native names from the Phoenician
coast. Already in the time of the thirteenth dynasty the larger
ships were termed <i>Kabanitu</i>, or "Gebalite"; we read also of
"boats" called <i>Za</i>, the Canaanite <i>Zi</i>, while a
transport was entitled <i>qauil</i>, the Phoenician <i>gol</i>. The
same name was imported into Greek under the form of <i>gaulos</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id=
"page246"></a>{246}</span> and we are told that it signified "a
Phoenician vessel of rounded shape."</p>
<p>The language of Canaan was practically that which we call
Hebrew. Indeed Isaiah (xix. 18) speaks of the two dialects as
identical, and the so-called Phoenician inscriptions that have been
preserved to us show that the differences between them were hardly
appreciable. There were differences, however; the Hebrew definite
article, for instance, is not found in the Phoenician texts. But
the differences are dialectal only, like the differences which the
discovery of the Moabite Stone has shown to have existed between
the languages of Moab and Israel.</p>
<p>How the Israelites came to adopt "the language of Canaan" is a
question into which we cannot here enter. There have been other
examples of conquerors who have abandoned the language of their
forefathers and adopted that of the conquered people. And it must
be remembered, on the one hand, that the ancestors of Israel had
lived in Canaan, where they would have learnt the language of the
country, and, on the other hand, that their original tongue was
itself a Semitic form of speech, as closely related to Hebrew as
French or Spanish is to Italian.</p>
<p>The Tel el-Amarna tablets have told us something about the
language of Canaan as it was spoken before the days when the
Israelites entered the land. Some of the letters that were sent
from Palestine contain the Canaanite equivalents of certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id=
"page247"></a>{247}</span> Babylonian words that occur in them.
Like the Babylonian words, they are written in cuneiform
characters, and since these denote syllables and not mere letters
we know exactly how the words were pronounced. It is an advantage
which is denied us by the Phoenician alphabet, whether in the
inscriptions of Phoenicia or in the pages of the Old Testament, and
we can thus obtain a better idea of the pronunciation of the
Canaanitish language in the century before the Exodus than we can
of the Hebrew language in the age of Hezekiah.</p>
<p>Among the words which have been handed down to us by the
correspondents of the Pharaoh are <i>maqani</i> "cattle,"
<i>anay</i> "a ship," <i>s&uacute;si</i> "a horse," of which the
Hebrew equivalents, according to the Masoretic punctuation, are
<i>miqneh</i>, <i>oni</i>, and <i>s&ucirc;s</i>. The king of
Jerusalem says <i>anuki</i>, "I," the Hebrew <i>anochi</i>, while
<i>badiu</i>, the Hebrew <i>b'yado</i>, and <i>akharunu</i>, the
Hebrew <i>akharono</i>, are stated to signify "in his hand," and
"after him." "Dust" is <i>ghaparu</i>, where the guttural <i>gh</i>
represents the Canaanitish <i>ayyin</i> ('); "stomach" is
<i>batnu</i>, the Hebrew <i>beten</i>; while <i>kilubi</i>, "a
cage," corresponds with the Hebrew <i>chel&ucirc;b</i>, which is
used in the same sense by the prophet Jeremiah. Elsewhere we find
<i>risu</i>, the Hebrew <i>rosh</i>, "a head," <i>har</i> "a
mountain," <i>samama</i> "heaven," and <i>mima</i> "water," in
Hebrew <i>sh&acirc;mayim</i> and <i>mayim</i>, which we gather from
the cuneiform spelling have been wrongly punctuated by the
Masoretes, as well as <i>khaya</i> "living," the Hebrew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id=
"page248"></a>{248}</span> <i>khai</i>, and <i>makhs&ucirc;</i>,
"they have smitten him," the Hebrew <i>makhatsu</i>.</p>
<p>It was the use of the definite article <i>ha(n)</i> which mainly
distinguished Hebrew and Phoenician or Canaanite one from the
other. And we have a curious indication in the Tel el-Amarna
tablets, that the same distinction prevailed between the language
of the Canaanites and that of the Edomites, who, as we learn from
the Old Testament, were so closely related to the Israelites. In
the letter to the Pharaoh, in which mention is made of the
hostilities carried on by Edom against the Egyptian territory, one
of the Edomite towns referred to is called Khinianabi. Transcribed
into Hebrew characters this would be 'En-han-nabi, "the Spring of
the Prophet." Here, therefore, the Hebrew article makes its
appearance, and that too in the very form which it has in the
language of Israel. The fact is an interesting commentary on the
brotherhood of Jacob and Esau.</p>
<p>If the language of Canaan was influenced by that of Egypt, still
more was it influenced by that of Babylonia. Long before Palestine
became an Egyptian province it had been a province of Babylonia.
And even when it was not actually subject to Babylonian government
it was under the dominion of Babylonian culture. War and trade
alike forced the Chald&aelig;an civilization upon "the land of the
Amorites," and the Canaanites were not slow to take advantage of
it. The cuneiform writing of Babylonia was adopted, and therewith
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id=
"page249"></a>{249}</span> the language of Babylonia was taught and
learned in the schools and libraries which were established in
imitation of those of the Babylonians. Babylonian literature was
introduced into the West, and the Canaanite youth became acquainted
with the history and legends, the theology and mythology of the
dwellers on the Euphrates and Tigris.</p>
<p>Such literary contact naturally left its impress on the language
of Canaan. Words which the Semites of Babylonia had borrowed from
the older Sumerian population of the country were handed on to the
peoples of Palestine. The "city" had been a Sumerian creation;
until brought under the influence of Sumerian culture, the Semite
had been contented to live in tents. Indeed in Babylonian or
Assyrian&mdash;the language of the Semitic inhabitants of Babylonia
and Assyria&mdash;the word which signified "tent" was adopted to
express the idea of "city" when the tent had been exchanged for
city-life. In Canaan, on the other hand, the Sumerian word itself
was adopted in a Semitic form, <i>'Ir</i>, <i>'ar</i>, or
<i>uru</i>, "city," was originally the Sumerian <i>eri</i>.</p>
<p>The Canaanitish <i>h&ecirc;k&acirc;l</i>, "a palace," again,
came from a Sumerian source. This was <i>&ecirc;-gal</i>, or "great
house." But it had passed to the West through the Semitic
Babylonians, who had first borrowed the compound word under the
form of <i>&ecirc;kallu</i>. Like the city, the palace also was
unknown to the primitive Semitic nomads. It belonged to the
civilization of which the Sumerians of Chald&aelig;a, with their
agglutinative language, were the pioneers.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id=
"page250"></a>{250}</span>
<p>The borrowing, however, was not altogether one-sided. Palestine
enriched the literary language of Babylonia with certain words,
though these do not seem to have made their way into the language
of the people. Thus we find words like <i>bin-bini</i>, "grandson,"
and <i>&icirc;nu</i>, "wine," recorded in the lexical tablets of
Babylonia and Assyria. Doubtless there were writers on the banks of
the Euphrates who were as anxious to exhibit their knowledge of the
language of Canaan as were the Egyptian scribes of the nineteenth
dynasty, though their literary works have not yet been
discovered.</p>
<p>The adoption of the Babylonian system of writing must have
worked powerfully on the side of tincturing the Canaanitish
language with Babylonian words. In the age of the Tel el-Amarna
tablets there is no sign that any other system was known in the
West. It is true that the letters sent to the Pharaoh from
Palestine were written in the Babylonian language as well as in the
Babylonian script, but we have evidence that the cuneiform
characters were also used for the native language of the country.
M. de Clercq possesses two seal-cylinders of the same date as the
Tel el-Amarna correspondence, on one of which is the cuneiform
inscription&mdash;"Hadad-sum, the citizen of Sidon, the crown of
the gods," while on the other is "Anniy, the son of Hadad-sum, the
citizen of Sidon." On the first, Hadad-sum is represented standing
with his hands uplifted before the Egyptian god Set, while behind
him is the god Resheph with a helmet <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page251" id="page251"></a>{251}</span> on his head, a shield in
one hand and a battle-axe in the other. On the seal of Anniy, Set
and Resheph again make their appearance, but instead of the owner
of the cylinder it is the god Horus who stands between them.</p>
<p>When the cuneiform syllabary was superseded in Palestine by the
so-called Phoenician alphabet we do not know. The introduction of
the new script was due probably to the Hittite invasion, which
separated the Semites of the West from the Semites of the East. The
Hittite occupation of Carchemish blocked the high-road of
Babylonian trade to the Mediterranean, and when the sacred city of
Kadesh on the Orontes fell into Hittite hands it was inevitable
that Hittite rather than Babylonian influence would henceforth
prevail in Canaan. However this may be, it seems natural to suppose
that the scribes of Zebulon referred to in the Song of Deborah and
Barak (Judges v. 14) wrote in the letters of the Phoenician
alphabet and not in the cuneiform characters of Babylonia. As long,
indeed, as the old libraries remained open and accessible, with
their stores of cuneiform literature, there must have been some who
could read them, but they would have been rather the older
inhabitants of the country than the alien conquerors from the
desert. When the Moabite Stone was engraved, it is clear from the
forms of the letters that the Phoenician alphabet had long been in
use in the kingdom of Mesha. The resemblance of these letters to
those found in the earliest of the Greek inscriptions <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>{252}</span> makes it
equally clear that the introduction of the alphabet into the
islands of the &AElig;gean must have taken place at no distant
period from the age of the Moabite Stone. Such an introduction,
however, implies that the new alphabet had already taken deep root
among the merchants of Canaan, and driven out before it the
cumbrous syllabary of Chald&aelig;a. It was in this alphabet that
Hiram and Solomon corresponded together, and it is probable that
Moses made use of it. We may even conjecture that the Israelitish
settlement in Palestine brought with it the gift of the
"Phoenician" alphabet.</p>
<p>As we have already seen, the elements of Babylonian art were
quickly absorbed by the Canaanites. The seal-cylinder was imitated,
at first with but indifferent success, and such Babylonian
ornamental designs as the rosette, the sacred tree, and the winged
cherub were taken over and developed in a special way. At times the
combination with them of designs borrowed from Egypt produced a new
kind of artistic ornament.</p>
<p>But it was in the realm of religion that the influence of
Babylonia was most powerful. Religion, especially in the ancient
world, was inextricably bound up with its culture; it was
impossible to adopt the one without adopting a good deal of the
other at the same time. Moreover, the Semites of Babylonia and of
Canaan belonged to the same race, and that meant a community of
inherited religious ideas. With both the supreme object of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id=
"page253"></a>{253}</span> worship was Baal or Bel, "the lord," who
was but the Sun-god under a variety of names. Each locality had its
own special Baal: there were, in fact, as many Baals, or Baalim, as
there were names and attributes for the Sun-god, and to the
worshippers in each locality the Baal adored there was the supreme
god. But the god resembled his worshipper who had been made in his
image; he was the father and head of a family with a wife and son.
The wife, it is true, was but the colourless reflection of the god,
often indeed but the feminine Baalah, whom the Semitic languages
with their feminine gender required to exist by the side of the
masculine Baal. But this was only in accordance with the Semitic
conception of woman as the lesser man, his servant rather than his
companion, his shadow rather than his helpmeet.</p>
<p>The existence of an independent goddess, unmarried and
possessing all the attributes of the god, was contrary to the
fundamental conceptions of the Semitic mind. Nevertheless we find
in Canaan an Ashtoreth, whom the Greeks called Astarte, as well as
a Baal. The cuneiform inscriptions have given us an explanation of
the fact.</p>
<p>Ashtoreth came from Babylonia. There she was known as Istar, the
evening star. She had been one of those Sumerian goddesses who, in
accordance with the Sumerian system, which placed the mother at the
head of the family, were on an equal footing with the gods. She lay
outside the circle of Semitic theology with its divine family,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id=
"page254"></a>{254}</span> over which the male Baal presided, and
the position she occupied in later Babylonian religion was due to
the fusion between the Sumerian and Semitic forms of faith, which
took place when the Semites became the chief element in Babylonia.
But Sumerian influence and memories were too strong to allow of any
transformation either in the name or in the attributes of the
goddess. She remained Istar, without any feminine suffix, and it
was never forgotten that she was the evening-star.</p>
<p>It was otherwise in the West. There Istar became Ashtoreth with
the feminine termination, and passed eventually into a Moon-goddess
"with crescent horns." Ashtoreth-Karnaim, "Ashtoreth with the two
horns," was already in existence in the age of Abraham. In
Babylonia the Moon-god of ancient Sumerian belief had never been
dethroned; but there was no Moon-god in Canaan, and accordingly the
transformation of the Babylonian goddess into "the queen of the
night" was a matter of little difficulty.</p>
<p>Once domesticated in Palestine, with her name so changed as to
declare her feminine character, Ashtoreth soon tended to lose her
independence. Just as there were Baalim or "Baals" by the side of
Baal, so there were Astaroth or "Ashtoreths" by the side of
Ashtoreth.</p>
<p>The Semites of Babylonia themselves had already begun the work
of transformation. They too spoke of Istar&acirc;t or "Istars," and
used the word <span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id=
"page255"></a>{255}</span> in the general sense of "goddesses." In
Canaan, however, Ashtar&ocirc;th had no such general meaning, but
denoted simply the various Ashtoreths who were worshipped in
different localities, and under different titles. The individual
Ashtoreth of Gebal was separate from the individual Ashtoreth of
Bashan, although they alike represented the same divine
personality.</p>
<p>It is true that even in the West Istar did not always become the
feminine complement of Baal. Here and there the old form of the
name was preserved, without any feminine suffix. But when this was
the case, the necessary result was that the female character of the
deity was forgotten. Istar was conceived of as a god, and
accordingly on the Moabite Stone Ashtar is identified with Chemosh,
the patron-god of Mesha, just as in Southern Arabia also Atthar is
a male divinity.</p>
<p>The worship of Ashtoreth absorbed that of the other goddesses of
Canaan. Among them there was one who had once occupied a very
prominent place. This was Ash&ecirc;rah, the goddess of fertility,
whose name is written Asirtu and Asratu in the tablets of Tel
el-Amarna. Ash&ecirc;rah was symbolized by a stem stripped of its
branches, or an upright cone of stone, fixed in the ground, and the
symbol and the goddess were at times confounded together. The
symbol is mistranslated "grove" in the Authorized Version of the
Old Testament, and it often stood by the side of the altar of Baal.
We find it thus represented on early seals. In Palestine it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id=
"page256"></a>{256}</span> usually of wood; but in the great temple
of Paphos in Cyprus there was an ancient and revered one of stone.
This, however, came to be appropriated to Ashtoreth in the days
when the older Ash&ecirc;rah was supplanted by the younger
Ashtoreth.</p>
<p>We hear of other Canaanitish divinities from the monuments of
Egypt. The goddess Edom, the wife of Resheph, has already been
referred to. Her name is found in that of the Gittite, Obed-Edom,
"the servant of Edom," in whose house the ark was kept for three
months (2 Sam. vi. 10). Resheph, too, has been mentioned in an
earlier page. He was the god of fire and lightning, and on the
Egyptian monuments he is represented as armed with spear and
helmet, and bears the titles of "great god" and "lord of heaven."
Along with him we find pictures of a goddess called Kedesh and
Kesh. She stands on the back of a lion, with flowers in her left
hand and a serpent in her right, while on her head is the lunar
disk between the horns of a cow. She may be the goddess Edom, or
perhaps the solar divinity who was entitled &Acirc; in Babylonian,
and whose name enters into that of an Edomite king A-rammu, who is
mentioned by Sennacherib.</p>
<p>But, like Istar, a considerable number of the deities of
Palestine were borrowed from Babylonia. In the Tel el-Amarna
tablets the god of Jerusalem is identified with the warlike Sun-god
of Babylonia, Nin-ip, and there was a sanctuary of the same
divinity further north, in Phoenicia. Foremost among the deities
whose first home was on the banks of <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page257" id="page257"></a>{257}</span> the Euphrates were Arm and
Anat, and Rimmon. Anu, whose name is written Anah in Hebrew, was
the god of the sky, and he stood at the head of the Babylonian
pantheon. His wife Anat was but a colourless reflection of himself,
a grammatical creation of the Semitic languages. But she shared in
the honours that were paid to her consort, and the divinity that
resided in him was reflected upon her. Anat, like Ashtoreth, became
multiplied under many forms, and the Anathoth or "Anat" signified
little more than "goddesses." Between the Ashtaroth and the
Anathoth the difference was but in name.</p>
<p>The numerous localities in Palestine which received their names
from the god Rimmon are a proof of his popularity. The Babylonian
Rimmon or Ramman was, strictly speaking, the god of the air, but in
the West he was identified with the Sun-god Hadad, and a place near
Megiddo bore the compound title of Hadad-Rimmon (Zech. xii. 11).
His naturalization in Canaan seems to belong to a very early
period; at all events, in Sumerian he was called Martu, "the
Amorite," and seal-cylinders speak of "the Martu gods." One of
these has been found in the Lebanon. The Assyrian tablets tell us
that he was also known as Dadu in the West, and under this form we
find him in names like El-Dad and Be-dad, or Ben-Dad.</p>
<p>Like Rimmon, Nebo also must have been transported to Palestine
at an early epoch. Nebo "the prophet" was the interpreter of
Bel-Merodach of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id=
"page258"></a>{258}</span> Babylon, the patron of cuneiform
literature, and the god to whom the great temple of
Borsippa&mdash;the modern Birs-i-Nimrud&mdash;was dedicated.
Doubtless he had migrated to the West along with that literary
culture over which he presided. There his name and worship were
attached to many localities. It was on the summit of Mount Nebo
that Moses died; over Nebo, Isaiah prophesies, "Moab shall howl;"
and we hear of a city called "the other Nebo" in Judah (Neh. vii.
33).</p>
<p>Another god who had been borrowed from Babylonia by the people
of Canaan was Malik "the king," a title originally of the supreme
Baal. Malik is familiarly known to us in the Old Testament as
Moloch, to whom the first-born were burned in the fire. At Tyre the
god was termed Melech-kirjath, or "king of the city," which was
contracted into Melkarth, and in the mouths of the Greeks became
Makar. There is a passage in the book of the prophet Amos (v. 25,
26), upon which the Assyrian texts have thrown light. We there
read: "Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the
wilderness forty years, O house of Israel? Yet ye have borne
Sikkuth your Malik and Chiun your Zelem, the star of your god,
which ye made to yourselves."</p>
<p>Sikkuth and Chiun are the Babylonian Sakkut and Kaivan, a name
given to the planet Saturn. Sakkut was a title of the god Nin-ip,
and we gather from Amos that it also represented Malik "the king."
Zelem, "the image," was another Babylonian <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>{259}</span> deity,
and originally denoted "the image" or disk of the sun. His name and
worship were carried into Northern Arabia, and a monument has been
discovered at Teima, the Tema of Isaiah xxi. 14, which is dedicated
to him. It would seem, from the language of Amos, that the
Babylonian god had been adored in "the wilderness" as far back as
the days when the Israelites were encamping in it. Nor, indeed, is
this surprising: Babylonian influence in the West belonged to an
age long anterior to that of the Exodus, and even the mountain
whereon the oracles of God were revealed to the Hebrew lawgiver was
Sinai, the mountain of Sin. The worship of Sin, the Babylonian
Moon-god, must therefore have made its way thus far into the
deserts of Arabia. Inscriptions from Southern Arabia have already
shown us that there too Sin was known and adored.</p>
<p>Dagon, again, was another god who had his first home in
Babylonia. The name is of Sumerian origin, and he was associated
with Ami, the god of the sky. Like Sin, he appears to have been
worshipped at Harran; at all events, Sargon states that he
inscribed the laws of that city "according to the wish of Anu and
Dagon." Along with Arm he would have been brought to Canaan, and
though we first meet with his name in the Old Testament in
connection with the Philistines, it is certain that he was already
one of the deities of the country whom the Philistine invaders
adopted. One of the Canaanitish governors in the Tel el-Amarna
correspondence <span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id=
"page260"></a>{260}</span> bears the Assyrian name of Dagon-takala,
"we trust in Dagon." The Phoenicians made him the god of corn in
consequence of the resemblance of his name to the word which
signifies "corn"; primarily, however, he would have been a god of
the earth. The idea that he was a fish-god is of post-Biblical
date, and due to a false etymology, which derived his name from the
Hebrew <i>dag</i>, "a fish." The fish-god of Babylonia, however,
whose image is sometimes engraved on seals, was a form of Ea, the
god of the deep, and had no connection with Dagon. Doubtless there
were other divinities besides these whom the peoples of Canaan owed
to the Babylonians. Mr. Tomkins is probably right in seeing in the
name of Beth-lehem a reminiscence of the Babylonian god Lakhmu, who
took part in the creation of the world, and whom a later
philosophizing generation identified with Anu. But the theology of
early Canaan is still but little known, and its pantheon is still
in great measure a sealed book. Now and again we meet with a
solitary passage in some papyrus or inscription on stone, which
reveals to us for the first time the name of an otherwise unknown
deity. Who, for instance, is the goddess 'Ashiti-Khaur, who is
addressed, along with Kedesh, on an Egyptian monument now at
Vienna, as "the mistress of heaven" and "ruler of all the gods"?
The votive altars of Carthage make repeated mention of the goddess
Tanit, the Peni or "Face" of Baal, whom the Greeks identified with
Artemis. She must have <span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id=
"page261"></a>{261}</span> been known in the mother-land of
Phoenicia, and yet no trace of her worship there has as yet been
found. There were "gods many and lords many" in primitive
Palestine, and though a comprehensive faith summed them up as its
Baalim and Ashtaroth they yet had individual names and titles, as
well as altars and priests.</p>
<p>But though altars were numerous, temples were not plentiful. The
chief seats of religious worship were "the high-places," level
spots on the summits of hills or mountains, where altars were
erected, and the worshipper was believed to be nearer the
dwelling-place of the gods than he would have been in the plain
below. The altar was frequently some natural boulder of rock,
consecrated by holy oil, and regarded as the habitation of a god.
These sacred stones were termed beth-els, <i>b&aelig;tyli</i> as
the Greeks wrote the word, and they form a distinguishing
characteristic of Semitic faith. In later times many of them were
imagined to have "come down from heaven." So deeply enrooted was
this worship of stones in the Semitic nature, that even Mohammed,
in spite of his iconoclastic zeal, was obliged to accommodate his
creed to the worship of the Black Stone at Mekka, and the Kaaba is
still one of the most venerated objects of the Mohammedan
faith.</p>
<p>But the sacred stone was not only an object of worship or the
consecrated altar of a deity, it might also take the place of a
temple, and so be in very truth a beth-el, or "house of God." Thus
at <span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id=
"page262"></a>{262}</span> Medain Salih in North-western Arabia Mr.
Doughty discovered three upright stones, which an inscription
informed him were the <i>mesged</i> or "mosque" of the god Aera of
Bozrah. In the great temple of Melkarth at Tyre Herodotus saw two
columns, one of gold, the other of emerald, reminding us of the two
pillars, Jachin and Boaz, which the Phoenician architect of Solomon
erected in the porch of the temple at Jerusalem (1 Kings vii. 21).
Similar columns of stone have been found in the Phoenician temple,
called that of the Giants, in Gozo, one of which is still standing
in its place.</p>
<p>While certain stones were thus regarded as the abode of deity,
the high places whereon so many of them stood also received
religious worship. The most prominent of the mountains of Syria
were deified: Carmel became a Penu-el or "Face of God," Hermon was
"the Holy One," and Mount Lebanon was a Baal. The rivers and
springs also were adored as gods, and the fish which swam in them
were accounted sacred. On the Phoenician coast was a river Kadisha,
"the holy," and the Canaanite maiden saw in the red marl which the
river Adonis brought down from the hills the blood of the
slaughtered Sun-god Tammuz.</p>
<p>The temple of Solomon, built as it was by Phoenician architects
and workmen, will give us an idea of what a Canaanitish temple was
like. In its main outlines it resembled a temple in Babylonia or
Assyria. There, too, there was an outer court and an inner
sanctuary, with its <i>parakku</i> <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page263" id="page263"></a>{263}</span> or "mercy-seat," and its
ark of stone or wood, in which an inscribed tablet of stone was
kept. Like the temple of Jerusalem, the Babylonian temple looked
from the outside much like a rectangular box, with its four walls
rising up, blank and unadorned, to the sky. Within the open court
was a "sea," supported at times on oxen of bronze, where the
priests and servants of the temple performed their ablutions and
the sacred vessels were washed.</p>
<p>The Canaanitish altar was approached by steps, and was large
enough for the sacrifice of an ox. Besides the sacrifices,
offerings of corn and wine, of fruit and oil were also made to the
gods. The sacrifices and offerings were of two kinds, the
<i>zau'at</i> or sin-offering, and the <i>shelem</i> or
thank-offering. The sin-offering had to be given wholly to the god,
and was accordingly termed <i>kalil</i> or "complete"; a part of
the thank-offering, on the other hand, might be carried away by him
who made it. Birds, moreover, might constitute a thank-offering;
they were not allowed when the offering was made for sin. Such at
least was the rule in the later days of Phoenician ritual, to which
belong the sacrificial tariffs that have been preserved.</p>
<p>In these sacrificial tariffs no mention is made of human
sacrifices, and, as M. Clermont-Ganneau has pointed out, the ram
takes in them the place of the man. But this was the result of the
milder manners of an age when the Phoenicians <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>{264}</span> had been
brought into close contact with the Greeks. In the older days of
Canaanitish history human sacrifice had held a foremost place in
the ritual of Syria. It was the sacrifice of the firstborn son that
was demanded in times of danger and trouble, or when the family was
called upon to make a special atonement for sin. The victim was
offered as a burnt sacrifice, which in Hebrew idiom was
euphemistically described as passing through the fire.</p>
<p>Side by side with these human sacrifices were the abominations
which were performed in the temples in honour of Ashtoreth. Women
acted as prostitutes, and men who called themselves "dogs"
foreswore their manhood. It was these sensualities practised in the
name of religion which caused the iniquity of the Canaanites to
become full.</p>
<p>It is pleasanter to turn to such fragments of Canaanitish
mythology and cosmological speculation as have come down to us.
Unfortunately most of it belongs in its present form to the late
days of Greek and Roman domination, when an attempt was made to
fuse the disjointed legends of the various Phoenician states into a
connected whole, and to present them to Greek readers under a
philosophical guise. How much, therefore, of the strange cosmogony
and history of the gods recorded by Philon of Gebal really goes
back to the patriarchal epoch of Palestine, and how much of it is
of later growth, it is now impossible to say. In the main, however,
it is of ancient date.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id=
"page265"></a>{265}</span>
<p>This is shown by the fact that a good deal of it has been
borrowed directly or indirectly from Babylonia. How this could have
happened has been explained by the Tel el-Amarna tablets. It was
while Canaan was under the influence of Babylonian culture and
Babylonian government that the myths and traditions of Babylonia
made their way to the West. Among the tablets are portions of
Babylonian legends, one of which has been carefully annotated by
the Egyptian or Canaanite scribe. It is the story of the queen of
Hades, who had been asked by the gods to a feast they had made in
the heavens. Unable or unwilling to ascend to it, the goddess sent
her servant the plague-demon, but with the result that Nergal was
commissioned to descend to Hades and destroy its mistress. The
fourteen gates of the infernal world, each with its attendant
warder, were opened before him, and at last he seized the queen by
the hair, dragging her to the ground, and threatening to cut off
her head. But Eris-kigal, the queen of Hades, made a successful
appeal for mercy; she became the wife of Nergal, and he the lord of
the tomb.</p>
<p>Another legend was an endeavour to account for the origin of
death. Adapa or Adama, the first man, who had been created by Ea,
was fishing one day in the deep sea, when he broke the wings of the
south wind. The south wind flew to complain to Anu in heaven, and
Anu ordered the culprit to appear before him. But Adapa was
instructed by <span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id=
"page266"></a>{266}</span> Ea how to act. Clad in a garment of
mourning, he won the hearts of the two guardians of the gate of
heaven, the gods Tammuz and Gis-zida ("the firmly-fixed post"), so
that they pleaded for him before Anu. Food and water were offered
him, but he refused them for fear that they might be the food and
water of death. Oil only for anointing and clothing did he accept.
"Then Anu looked upon him and raised his voice in lamentation: 'O
Adapa, wherefore atest thou not, wherefore didst thou not drink?
The gift of life cannot now be thine.'" Though "a sinful man" had
been permitted "to behold the innermost parts of heaven and earth,"
he had rejected the food and water of life, and death henceforth
was the lot of mankind.</p>
<p>It is curious that the commencement of this legend, the latter
portion of which has been found at Tel el-Amarna, had been brought
to the British Museum from the ruins of the library of Nineveh many
years ago. But until the discovery of the conclusion, its meaning
and character were indecipherable. The copy made for the library of
Nineveh was a late edition of the text which had been carried from
Babylonia to the banks of the Nile eight hundred years before, and
the fact emphasizes once more the Babylonian character of the
culture and literature possessed by Palestine in the Patriarchal
Age.</p>
<p>We need not wonder, therefore, if it is to Babylonia that the
cosmological legends and beliefs of <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page267" id="page267"></a>{267}</span> Phoenicia plainly point.
The watery chaos out of which the world was created, the divine
hierarchies, one pair of deities proceeding from another and an
older pair, or the victory of Kronos over the dragon Ophioneus, are
among the indications of their Babylonian origin. But far more
important than these echoes of Babylonian mythology in the
legendary lore of Phoenicia is the close relationship that exists
between the traditions of Babylonia and the earlier chapters of
Genesis. As is now well known, the Babylonian account of the Deluge
agrees even in details with that which we find in the Bible, though
the polytheism of Chald&aelig;a is there replaced by an
uncompromising monotheism, and there are little touches, like the
substitution of an "ark" for the Babylonian "ship," which show that
the narrative has been transported to Palestine. Equally Babylonian
in origin is the history of the Tower of Babel, while two of the
rivers of Eden are the Tigris and Euphrates, and Eden itself is the
Edin or "Plain" of Babylonia.</p>
<p>Not so long ago it was the fashion to declare that such
coincidences between Babylonian and Hebrew literature could be due
only to the long sojourn of the Jews in Babylonia during the twenty
years of the Exile. But we now know that the traditions and legends
of Babylonia were already known in Canaan before the Israelites had
entered the Promised Land. It was not needful for the Hebrew writer
to go to Chald&aelig;a in order that he might learn them; when
Moses was born they <span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id=
"page268"></a>{268}</span> were already current both in Palestine
and on the banks of the Nile. The Babylonian colouring of the early
chapters of Genesis is just what archaeology would teach us to
expect it would have been, had the Pentateuch been of the age to
which it lays claim.</p>
<p>Here and there indeed there are passages which must be of that
age, and of none other. When in the tenth chapter of Genesis Canaan
is made the brother of Cush and Mizraim, of Ethiopia and Egypt, we
are carried back at once to the days when Palestine was an Egyptian
province. The statement is applicable to no other age.
Geographically Canaan lay outside the southern zone to which Egypt
and Ethiopia belonged, except during the epoch of the eighteenth
and nineteenth dynasties, when all three were alike portions of a
single empire. With the fall of that empire the statement ceased to
be correct or even conceivable. After the era of the Israelitish
conquest Canaan and Egypt were separated one from the other, not to
be again united save for a brief space towards the close of the
Jewish monarchy. Palestine henceforth belonged to Asia, not to
Africa, to the middle zone, that is to say, which was given over to
the sons of Shem.</p>
<p>There is yet another passage in the same chapter of Genesis
which takes us back to the Patriarchal Age of Palestine. It is the
reference to Nimrod, the son of Cush, the beginning of whose
kingdom was Babel and Erech, and Accad and Calneh in <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>{269}</span> the land
of Shinar, and who was so familiar a figure in the West that a
proverb was current there concerning his prowess in the chase. Here
again we are carried to a date when the Kassite kings of Babylonia
held rule in Canaan, or led thither their armies, and when the
Babylonians were called, as they are in the Tel el-Amarna tablets,
the Kassi or sons of Cush. Nimrod himself may be the Kassite
monarch Nazi-Murudas. The cuneiform texts of the period show that
the names borne by the Kassite kings were strangely abbreviated by
their subjects; even in Babylonia, Kasbe and Sagarta-Suria, for
instance, being written for Kasbeias and Sagarakti-Suryas, the
latter of which even appears as Sakti-Surias, while Nazi-Murudas
itself is found under the form of Nazi-Rattas. Similarly Duri-galzu
and Kurigalzu take the place of Dur-Kurigalzi. There is no reason,
therefore, why Nazi-Murudas should not have been familiarly known
as Na-Muruda, more especially in distant Canaan.</p>
<p>Indeed we can almost fix the date to which the lifetime of
Nimrod must be assigned. We are told that out of his kingdom "one
went forth into Assyria," and there "builded" Nineveh and Calah,
The cuneiform inscriptions have informed us who this builder of
Calah was. He was Shalmaneser I., who was also the restorer of
Nineveh and its temples, and who is stated by Sennacherib to have
reigned six hundred years before himself. Such a date would
coincide with the reign of Ramses II., <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>{270}</span> the
Pharaoh of the Oppression, as well as with the birth-time of Moses.
It represents a period when the influence of Babylonia had not yet
passed away from Canaan, and when there was still intercourse
between the East and the West. Ramses claims to have overcome both
Assyria and Shinar, and though the Shinar he means was the Shinar
of Mesopotamia and not Chald&aelig;a, it lay within the limits of
Babylonian control. The reign of Ramses II. is the latest period
down to which, with our present knowledge, we can regard the old
influence of Babylonia in Canaan as still continuing, and it is
equally the period to which, if we are to listen to the traditional
teaching of the Church, the writer of the Pentateuch belonged. The
voice of archaeology is thus in agreement with that of authority,
and here as elsewhere true science declares herself the handmaid of
the Catholic Church.</p>

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
